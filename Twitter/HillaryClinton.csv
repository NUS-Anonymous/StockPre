HillaryClinton;2018-05-09 10:02;6222;27754;"It will also be harder to deal with other threats like ballistic missiles and terrorism. Now we have no leverage and Iran is free to do what it wants.

HillaryClinton;2018-05-09 10:02;6467;30540;"As Secretary of State, I helped negotiate the crippling international sanctions that brought Iran to the table. It would be much harder a second time, now that our credibility is shot."
HillaryClinton;2018-05-09 10:02;19630;87045;"Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal is a big mistake. It makes America less safe and less trusted. Iran is now more dangerous. What's plan B? Anyone who thinks bombing is the answer is woefully misinformed."
