Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 16:39;1;0;"Power is how one can also jam a radio signal. You flood the entire frequency channel with more power and drown out whatever’s there. Try streaming video on 2.4GHz while popping corn in the microwave oven nearby. Will get a lot of this...pic.twitter.com/rUW0zHOv47"
Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 16:37;1;0;"The frequency itself is not the issue - it’s the amount of power that you pump into it which causes issues. Have a look at your microwave oven. It emits at 2.4GHz just like WiFi, but instead of 0.1W of power, you can crank it up 7.5K times that to 750W. Radiation confined to cook"
Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 15:23;2;11;"I have no fear of WiFi on the 2.4GHz band with 100mW of output like in most of the world (USA has 10x that due to larger homess. Japan has 10x LESS) because the amount of radiation emitted out of that throughout a year is almost as much as an hour long phone call."
Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 15:14;0;6;"And even worse than the devices we carry & use, think about the radio base stations they’ll be mounting on the top/sides of buildings and what impact that may have on the tenants. The output of radio power on that is far, far higher."

Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 15:01;2;8;"The telecom industry is feeling a lot of pressure to build new technology cycles because of the endless competition emerging from the Far East. They deploy 3G, but lose market share. They deploy 4G, but lose market share. They’re racing to deploy 5G, but at whose cost? Ours."
Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 14:58;2;8;"If 5G is going to operate at frequency bands that are 5-10 higher than WiFi, then one would expect a coverage cell that is proportionally smaller if same amount of power was used. That won’t be the case, and that’s what worries me."
Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 14:47;0;8;"The more data you wish to transmit/receive, the higher the frequency you need between each radio wave. However, if you want more distance for that high frequency, you’re going to need to output more power. Power produces heat and rapid battery consumption."
Samir_Madani;2018-02-27 14:44;19;84;"For the past 17 years, I’ve specialized my career in mobile broadband tech. It was amazing. I saw it evolve from just 9.6Kbps to hundreds of Mbps.
