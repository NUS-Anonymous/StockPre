Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:31;0;2;"Ah, on that we are in complete agreement!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:30;0;2;"In the UK it is sometimes called "citizen's income" or "citizen's dividend". Something that is yours by right, not earned."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:28;0;0;"If there is no such right, the JG is workfare."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:27;0;0;"therefore implicitly underpinning any non-coercive JG scheme must be a universal right to receive income without working for it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:25;0;0;"TBH this is specious. Right to refuse work without penalty is essential in a JG scheme if it is not to be workfare. The spillover effect is that all workers acquire the right to refuse work without penalty, because refusing private sector work creates JG eligibility."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:21;0;2;"In the US, ideally constitutional amendment. UK more tricky - no Parliament can bind a future Parliament (hence no written constitution). Best to embed it in the ECHR, but that would require pan-European agreement. Failing that, binding legislation & hope no future Parl repeals."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:16;0;2;"Good, then we are in broad agreement. I'm not opposed to JG. I'm just aware of its limitations. As I am with # UBI, too. I'm a firm supporter, but I don't regard it as a panacea."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:14;0;0;"yes, the present trend is towards harshness. That's a response to hard times. It will reverse eventually."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:13;0;0;"But you also need legally enforceable "Right to refuse employment without penalty". Otherwise JG becomes workfare. As I said."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:12;0;1;"Like UBI, then. UBI is a legally enforceable right. It is not "welfare"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:10;0;1;"Interestingly, Nick's link acknowledges that JG needs to be underpinned by other measures."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:08;0;0;"Avoiding the language doesn't stop it becoming de facto workfare at the margin - as I have already explained."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:06;0;1;"I agree JG is better than nothing. I don't agree that it is sufficient by itself."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:05;0;0;"It's actually how the proposals are implemented in practice at the local level that really matters."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 04:00;0;0;"Hmm, there are always ways of gaming that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:53;0;0;"How sure are you that a JG would not be used to force sick & disabled into wholly inappropriate work with the threat of benefit withdrawal if they did not comply?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:52;0;0;"Similarly, benefits eligibility for sick & disabled people has now been tightened in the UK to the point of brutality because of popular anger against them, largely due to media portraying them as scroungers and shirkers. UN has censured UK for its treatment of disabled."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:47;0;0;"How sure are you that a US JG would not be equally brutal to, say, Afro-Caribbeans or Hispanics, for similar reasons?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:46;0;1;"Whether a JG programme is benign or brutal depends entirely on political attitudes. The Irish JG programme was brutal because of the English attitude to the Irish. Media portrayed the Irish as lazy, dependent, brutish. Policy was deliberately harsh because of this."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:39;1;0;"Do we have to keep talking about the US's appalling healthcare system? The UK's care system is not remotely similar."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:38;0;0;"They were. But they could easily have been productive. The area desperately needed roads. Doesn't change the fact that people who couldn't do the work starved."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:19;0;0;"What do you know about those Irish JG programmes?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 03:14;0;0;"Professional singing career is only for those who like precarity. Otherwise you end up teaching to make ends meet. I speak from experience."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:59;0;0;"I can't afford to pay existing care home fees, let alone higher ones. And I'm not poorly paid."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:58;0;0;"I have pointed it out many times."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:57;0;0;"I think what really turned me off unsupported JG was reading about the JG programmes in the Irish famine."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:56;0;0;"JG has been tried many times in the UK and has always ended up as workfare. Very long history. Literally centuries of repeated JG programs, all of which became coercive and some of which were brutal."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:31;0;0;"I was tagged into this thread, so I assumed it was a general discussion."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:30;0;0;"It was never about specifically US proposals as far as I was concerned. If it were, I would not have participated. I am not American and I don't live in the US."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:28;0;0;"I don't expect UBI to change that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:28;0;0;"By "state" I mean government - you would say "federal"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:26;0;0;"Define "modest increase", and tell us who should pay it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:25;0;1;"Perhaps you could learn from how other countries do things."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:23;0;0;"I don't live in the US. Why do you assume that the US is the only country worth discussing?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:22;0;0;"But that is not true in the UK, or indeed anywhere in Europe. Why do we have to use the US's awful healthcare system as justification for JG?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:20;0;1;"UBI can't replace all welfare programs."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:16;0;0;"Not necessarily."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:13;0;0;"No. The biggest group by far are state pensioners."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:12;0;2;"I don't think you know much about the NHS."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:10;0;0;"Why would nurses get a pay rise in a JG system? They are paid far more than care workers and other people at the bottom of the pile."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:03;0;0;"Also, in existing systems, withdrawal of benefits when people find work after periods of unemployment or sickness can cause very high marginal tax rates. Serious disincentive to work. How would a non-coercive JG work in such a system?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 02:01;0;0;"In existing systems, access to benefits is often withdrawn if people refuse work. Why do you think this would be different under a JG? The point of UBI is that it cannot be withdrawn. It is therefore a safeguard against exploitation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:57;0;0;"It's actually good for rich countries with inadequate social welfare systems, like the US."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:57;0;1;"Some social programs would of course be unnecessary in a UBI system. But not all. I'm not in favour of dismantling everything. I see UBI as a foundation on which both earned and unearned income can be built."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:55;0;0;"The evidence from minimum wage hikes in the UK is that it does translate into higher prices."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:54;0;0;"Without UBI or equivalent underpinning it, it is workfare. And if you had a decent universal healthcare system, you wouldn't even consider workfare as a means of giving people access to healthcare. That's what the workhouses did."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:50;1;1;"I have not labelled Sanders' program at all. I am British. We do not have Medicare. We have the NHS, access to which is not dependent on employment. I find the idea of using a JG program to ensure universal access to healthcare abhorrent, frankly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:42;0;0;"And I might argue that everyone could benefit from working less. In 1870, full-time work was 10-12 hours per day, six or even seven days a week. Now it is 35-40 hours, five days a week. This is progress."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:39;0;0;"I might say that enabling sick &a disabled people to leave the workforce could be a goal of policy. At present, they are being brought back into e workforce through harsh conditionality on their benefit claims."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:38;0;0;"So I might say that enabling young parents to leave the workforce, or work fewer hours, if they wish could be a goal of policy."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:37;0;0;"For example, I might argue that enabling some groups to leave the workforce should be a goal of policy - as it was in the mid-19th century. Full employment in 1830 meant men, women and children. By 1870, it no longer meant children. This is progress."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:34;0;0;"I also don't agree with your assumption that keeping the maximum number of people employed should be the goal of policy."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:33;0;0;"It is by no means evident that de-mechanisation is necessary to achieve full employment. That is a Luddite argument. I'd remind you too that you have not defined "full employment". Full employment in the 1930s did not include married women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:30;0;0;"But I'm not trying to "put the most people back to work". I want to support people with UBI so they can find interesting, creative and productive things to do. I think a JG could help them to find these things. But I'm not interested in work for its own sake."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:27;0;0;"Mechanised jobs don't have to be carbon intensive either. I'm amazed by your Luddism."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:26;0;0;"Really think you should consider what nursing unions mean by "paid little". Paid little by comparison with whom? Certainly not care workers. Nurses are very well paid compared to care workers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:23;0;0;"I'm saying that employment is not the purpose of work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:23;0;0;"Comparison is invidious. Nursing is a profession with high barriers to entry (professional qualifications). That is not the case in the care sector. Nurses are paid far more than care workers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:21;0;0;"There are MANY people who don't live off wage labour. Especially in ageing societies. Not just a fortunate few."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:20;0;0;"So strictly speaking, JG requires some form of UBI ago prevent it becoming workfare. Why are you so anxious to avoid UBI?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:18;0;0;"Oh, and UBI is not welfare."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:18;0;0;"Universal basic services is a form of UBI."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 01:17;0;0;"Yes. What difference does that make to the argument? Sounds like "whataboutery" to me."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 00:54;0;0;"Well, as you've misunderstood everything else I've said, your inability to understand this comes as no surprise."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 00:52;0;0;"Nurses are entirely different. The care sector depends on there being large numbers of people, mainly women, working for very low pay. If wages go up, then unless tech replaces employment to some extent, prices will rise."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-09 00:48;0;0;"No, it really isn't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 20:28;0;0;"Well, quite"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 20:23;0;0;"Indeed, but unless it is segregated, it is not clear what is client money and what is not. That's why custodians have to be regulated."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 19:44;0;0;"Banks can be custodians. In the present system they aren't, but then the present system is not full reserve."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:36;3;6;"As I said right from the start, LN essentially re-creates the existing banking system, but with fewer safeguards. It is neither revolutionary nor progressive.https://twitter.com/evanthefreeman/status/993785984192921600 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:35;1;2;"Banks, in fact."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:34;0;1;"To be fair, most JG advocates seem to want JG wages to be higher, not lower, than those in the care sector. This would force up private sector wages too. But the cost implications for elderly care need to be thought through."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:32;0;0;"Also, as I have now said THREE TIMES, all the Bill would do is force the govt to conduct a review. Parliament will not be asked to vote on the APPG's proposed measures."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:30;0;0;"That is not what the Bill does. And at the moment, the campaigns don't agree on what an "equitable solution" would look like, anyway. The whole point of the APPG meeting was to try to get them to agree on something Parliament might accept. It failed."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:28;1;3;"And it's either going to become very centralised or grind to a halt. Clever tech, but incomprehensible to ordinary people and relies on people behaving in pretty unnatural ways - like trusting each other."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:18;0;2;"As I am only a few days younger than the youngest 1950s women, my life has been much like theirs. The 1950s generation is not "special"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:14;0;0;"TBH I would not regard pension at 60, or the equivalent, for 1950s women but no-one else as in any way "equitable"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:13;0;0;"There is zero parliamentary support for restoring SPA of 60 for 1950s women, for unconditional payments to 1950s women from 60, or for compensation for SPA rises for 1950s women. The APPG made this crystal clear. Hence the dumbed down proposals."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:11;0;0;"You will also have a hard time convincing anyone that you should have pension at 60 but men of your age should not. It's blatant discrimination and almost certainly illegal under the 2010 Equalities Act. I remind you that legislation to equalise SPA was passed over 20 years ago."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 17:08;0;0;"Time is not on your side, sadly. Once those worst affected by the 2011 Act reach SPA, these campaigns will fizzle out. You have less than a year."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 16:55;0;0;"The three measures are: - full SP regardless of NI contributions for 1950s women, not backdated (so nothing for those already receiving reduced SP bcs of insufficient NICs) - unconditional allowance from 63 (JSA amount, so much less than SP) - pension credit top-up for poorest"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 16:50;0;0;"I have read the APPG's report, and I was present at the meeting that discussed it. The report proposes three measures, all of which fall a LONG way short of SP from 60 or equivalent."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-08 16:23;0;1;"The 2011 Act added a maximum of 18 months to women's SPA. The bulk of the SPA rise - up to 5 years - comes from the 1995 Act, for which you had over 15 years' notice. Many people think the 2011 Act was unfair, but your SPA was well above 60 long before that."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:39;0;0;"No, but your efforts would have been considerably less valuable (to those you cared for, which is what matters) than those of a skilled worker using advanced technology. In this discussion we seem to have lost sight of the primary purpose of work."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:26;0;0;"It's been a theme of mine for years. Care work is a skilled profession which is underpaid because historically it has been done unpaid, mainly by women.

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:09;0;0;"I might add, that you have just used the "tu quoque" form of ad hominem argument. How I respond to other UBI advocates is of no relevance here. Address the subject, please."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:07;0;0;"There are an awful lot of people who are not convinced by your arguments. You seem to dismiss their views as of no value."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:04;0;0;"You need to explain why a program of 60 years standing was dismantled. I do not accept "politics" as an adequate explanation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:03;0;0;"I have been told that many, many times. That you can come up with such an analogy demonstrates how firmly embedded you are in your echo chamber. You do not know the reality of being an open Remain supporter on Twitter."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:01;0;0;"That won't do. Why did the people who elected that government decide that a job guarantee programme wasn't a good idea (or wasn't needed)?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 07:00;0;0;"Yes, I do think you are in an echo chamber. You all talk to each other, the arguments you come up with are only validated by people who agree with your basic premise, and you resort to ad homs when challenged."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:55;0;0;"You need to think through why the programme did not continue, and come up with good economic reasons for reinstating it. Blaming it on "conservative governments" won't do."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:54;0;0;"And adopting such a programme in 2018 is a good idea why, exactly?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:52;0;0;"I am not the only person who thinks it is inapplicable. But those who think like me are outside the JG echo chamber. Perhaps you should look outside it too."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:38;0;0;"Why was it stopped?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:32;0;0;"I don't think it can."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:31;0;0;"Why do you have to resort to put-downs and ad hominems? They are beneath you, Nathan. I expected better from you."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:30;0;0;"I'm familiar with the Jefes program. It's not remotely applicable to a developed Western country IMHO."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 06:29;0;0;"I'd rather have the infrastructure now, frankly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:56;0;0;"I've asked you a specific question about the nature of a JG for women. Please answer it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:55;0;0;"Unemployment in the 1930s was far higher than today. It was far higher than in the Great Recession. Please tell me why you think measures appropriate for 30% unemployment are also appropriate for 4%?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:53;0;0;"Oh, and please tell me why infrastructure should only be built in a recession?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:53;0;1;"The production methods that worked in the 1930s have been superseded. Technological progress, you know. Why do you want to turn the clock back? And why do you think people would want to work like that now?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:51;0;0;"Please tell me why building infrastructure requires a JG?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:50;0;0;"Saw that earlier. He is such a shyster."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:49;0;1;"People are born into particular faith groups, and those faith groups can define their identity even if they don't practise the religion."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:48;0;0;"So the Nazis were able to define Jews as "Jews" regardless of whether they practised the religion. We are seeing similar attitudes to Muslims: people of Syrian origin, for example, defined as "Muslim" even if they don't practise the religion, sometimes even if they are Christian."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:43;0;0;"And in Judaism, membership is inherited."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:41;0;0;"In some kinds of Christianity also (notably Catholicism) membership is by virtue of family origin, not personal practice. A non-practising ("lapsed") Catholic is still a Catholic."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:37;0;1;"I don't think it is possible to make such a clear distinction in practice. Particularly where Islam is concerned, since it is a social religion - people are Muslim because of their family connections, not because they have necessarily chosen Islam as a personal faith path."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:15;0;0;"I'd remind you also that women now make up a large proportion of the workforce, which was not the case in the 1930s. What sort of jobs would you guarantee for unskilled women?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:14;0;0;"the fact is that we do not employ armies of people to break stones for roads any more. The need for navvy gangs is much reduced. It is not clear to me why turning the clock back 80 or more years is such a great idea."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:13;0;0;"You seem to be arguing that jobs that have been mechanised in the last 80 years should no longer be mechanised, and that skills that people have developed to operate that machinery should therefore become redundant."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:10;0;0;"Why do you think the present economic situation is in any way like the 1930s?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:09;0;0;"I'm challenging you to name a job that genuinely needs no skills and yet justifies good pay and benefits."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:09;0;1;"Possibly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:08;0;0;"But I am saying the opposite. Things that you think any unskilled person can do with minimal training in fact require extensive skills and training. They are low paid for historical (and unacceptable) reasons, not because they are unskilled jobs."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 05:04;13;8;"Ridiculous.https://twitter.com/paul__johnson/status/993219528749473792 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:18;0;1;"Now if you will excuse me, I am going to the gym. Which is staffed by SKILLED people. I don't particularly want unskilled unemployed staffing public sector gyms, either."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:17;0;1;"Basic income would be better for artists."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:17;0;0;""employers". Yup, the people who are paying for their elderly relatives' care. The parents who are paying for their child care. Yup, they will REALLY want to pay more so the unskilled unemployed can help care for their relatives and their children."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:14;0;0;"I don't think "find them a job, any job, even if it could be better done by a skilled person or a machine" is a good enough answer for the unemployed and underemployed, period."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:13;0;0;"Historical research - yes, if we have unemployed history graduates, we could put them to work doing historical research. How many unemployed history graduates do you think there are?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:12;0;0;"Also, we don't build roads or schools now the way we did then. We don't deploy armies of labourers to break stones for roads now. We have machines to do that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:10;0;2;"We had public art in the 1930s because artists were unemployed, not because anyone can do public art. The 1930s was a period of exceptionally high unemployment. Not remotely similar situation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:08;0;0;"I am saying that skills matter. I want those jobs to be more skilled, not less."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:08;0;0;"They will say SKILLED support. Suitable support. Not just anyone. Not unskilled unemployed who can't do anything else. That's not "support"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:07;0;0;"I want the skill level of all of those jobs to be upgraded, not downgraded. I want them to become proper well-paid vocations with a career structure and job-specific qualifications. But you want those jobs to be the last resort of the unskilled unemployed. No thanks."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 01:05;0;0;"I don't want sick people cared for by "nursing aides" who have no commitment to the job and don't give a stuff about their welfare. I don't want people with poor literacy "helping" teachers. And I don't want child care to be a grunt job for people who can't find anything else."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:59;0;1;"So, try again. Suggest some GENUINELY unskilled jobs that the public sector could create."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:59;0;1;"And Matt has already pointed out that building/construction projects these days do not use unskilled labour. Nor do jobs like "weatherizing homes" (indeed these were always skilled jobs, just ask any roofer"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:57;0;12;"None of those are unskilled. Not one. I am sick and tired of hearing assertions from men who have never worked the caring and admin jobs traditionally done by part-time women that those jobs are unskilled and anyone can do them."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:56;0;0;"Oh, I completely agree that risk doesn't disappear, it just gets shifted. My point was more that tokenisation of physical assets doesn't even shift the risk much."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:54;0;0;"So I repeat, name me productive jobs that the public sector could guarantee to create for unskilled people with poor literacy and other difficulties. Go on, name them."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:52;0;0;"There can be graduate unemployment, yes. But the pool of long-term unemployed generally consists of people with low literacy, low skills and/or problems that reduce their flexibiility."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:50;0;0;""
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:41;0;0;"I am struggling to see what. Maybe @ HappySisyphus has some ideas."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:40;0;0;"YES!!! The more specialized we become, the more difficult it is to make a JG work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:38;0;1;"Why do you think there could be public jobs for the unskilled with good pay and benefits? Name me an unskilled job that these people could do. And DON'T say "elderly care". Elderly care is, or should be, a skilled job."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:37;0;0;"Paying a lawyer is the only certainty"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:36;0;1;"Making the securitisation process more efficient does not displace the underlying risk that the physical asset doesn't exist, isn't valuable or has already been pledged elsewhere. A token is only a representation of the physical asset, not the asset itself."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:33;0;0;"but it's about people's ability to learn, not about the availability of telephones and email. The more advanced technology is, the more difficult it is for those without skills to catch up."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:27;0;0;"bottom line is, you can't turn back the clock. The unskilled jobs of today are turning burgers at Macdonalds and walking round Amazon warehouses. You think the public sector should create jobs like that? Forgive me, but I don't, and I'd rather the private sector didn't either."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:24;0;0;"umm how long do you think it takes to train unemployed people who have a low educational level and poor skills to operate advanced machinery?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:22;0;0;"It doesn't even displace it, if physical assets are involved. Still need a custodian."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:22;0;0;"Yes, I've read that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:21;0;1;"tbh the sort of jobs JG advocates tend to cite as JG-suitable speaks volumes about their attitude to social care and the arts. They wouldn't suggest that unemployed people could be deployed on advanced engineering projects. But elderly care, that's just fine."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:18;0;1;"I also often see the arts as an example of an industry that would benefit from a JG. But the arts BY DEFINITION require skilled workers - skills that take years and years to develop. How, please, would a JG benefit this industry?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:17;0;0;"I often see elderly care cited as the sort of job that a JG program could create. But I would rather my elderly father was cared for by skilled workers who had chosen elderly care as a career than by unskilled workers who are only doing that until something better turns up."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:13;0;1;"I don't glorify "jobs" like that. I think that employing armies of unskilled workers is not necessarily the best way of producing things of value for society."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:09;0;2;"I don't think putting unemployed people to work at the expense of technological progress and skills development should be a central goal."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:08;0;0;"I never said otherwise. I said it did not eliminate the fundamental risk."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-07 00:00;0;2;"imho a lot of the JG arguments read like nostalgia for a bygone age - an "army of workers" with entirely transferable skills that can be deployed to do absolutely anything. People don't work like that any more. Technology doesn't work like that any more. Skills matter."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 23:55;0;2;"This is exactly the point I was making. Tokenisation could make the dematerialisation process itself more transparent and potentially efficient. But it makes no difference to the fundamental risk that the physical asset itself doesn't exist, isn't available or isn't valuable."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 23:13;0;0;"Exactly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 23:12;0;0;"Using ad hominems indicates you have lost the argument."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 23:11;0;0;"Keep trying."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 23:11;0;0;"You've completely misinterpreted my comment and ignored the context. By all means go on an unhinged rant about your own agenda, but not in response to my tweets that were not even addressed to you. Muted."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 23:07;0;0;"Eh???"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:20;0;0;"And I am more than slightly tired of "you don't understand the tech" as the stock answer to any informed criticism of the legal, financial and economic implications of blockchain use and token issuance."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:18;0;1;""tokenising" the legal title is exactly the same as producing a bearer bond backed by the deeds to a house."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:17;0;0;"The house may not exist, or there may be another claim on it, or it may not be worth what the owner says it is. All of those are risks in securitisation. There is NO DIFFERENCE between recording the legal title on a blockchain and recording it in a traditional asset register."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:16;0;0;"yes I do. You do not understand securitisation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:14;0;2;"I use "racism" in its original sense. You are aware that the term was originally used to mean the attitude of the Nazis to the Slavs and the Jews? Blond, blue-eyed humans saw themselves as superior to everyone else."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:11;0;0;"You don't seem to understand that the key risk point for a security backed with physical assets is the physical assets. Physical assets can't be put on a blockchain. Only their representation can - and that can be wrong."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:10;0;0;"But you do not know if the asset exists, and you do not know if there are other claims. The piece I retweeted said the key issue was having a good custodian. A custodian is a trusted third party who safeguards pledged assets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:08;0;0;"Blockchain is no better at proving title than a traditional asset registry. You can't change entries written on vellum with a quill pen and squid ink, you know. It's an immutable record."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 21:06;0;2;"But we are discussing diamonds and gold, not Bitcoin. Blockchain does not prove that they exist or that the securities issuer has undisputed title to them, any more than a traditional ledger or asset registry does. For physical assets, blockchain does not change anything."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 20:41;0;6;"It's a practical argument. I don't really care about dictionary definitions. We are talking about brutal treatment of one group of humans by another group purely because they are perceived as "different". I'm happy to call that racism."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 20:39;0;0;"Yes, I agree."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 20:37;0;0;"The market value of asset-backed securities thus fundamentally depends on the trustworthiness of the issuer. That is as true of tokens as it is of bonds."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 20:35;1;3;"Increased transparency in the tokenisation process makes no difference to the fundamental risks with any asset-backed security, which are that the issuer doesn't have title to the assets, or they don't exist, or they aren't worth what the issuer claims they are."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 20:32;0;0;"I'm therefore criticising the "blockchain will solve the problems of the financial system" argument from an informed position. So far, I have seen no real indication that it will make a material difference."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 20:29;0;0;"The FACT is that I am not a journalist and never have been. I am a contributor to Forbes, and an occasional writer for other media publications, but that doesn't make me a journalist. Professionally, I'm a financial writer."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 17:04;0;0;"I find it incredibly depressing that people like you, touting blockchain as a solution to problems in the financial system, seem to know so little about the financial system."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-06 17:02;1;2;"That's just one example. Nobody is touting it as "ooh, someone has securitised diamonds for the first time". That's because it is NOT the first time. Diamonds have been securitised for centuries. Like all valuable physical assets."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:10;0;0;"Now you too are not respecting my request for this conversation to end. It is unproductive TIME and I need to do some WORK."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:09;0;0;"Your preference for workfare appears to be ideological. I specifically said that UBI and JG are complementary. I said that JG needs UBI to prevent it becoming workfare, and UBI needs JG to prevent it being inflationary. What is "ideological" about that, please?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:07;0;0;"umm, how much do you know about local administration?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:06;0;1;"this is my view too. But when you are a state administrator tasked with finding socially useful jobs for lots of people, ensuring those jobs are personally fulfilling is likely to be low on the priority list."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:05;0;0;"I also think those who were on government job schemes would suffer social stigma. That's been the evidence of previous workfare schemes - the "Youth Opportunities Scheme", for example. Easy to exploit those people. I'm not a great believer in state benevolence."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:03;0;0;"I'm not sure that replacing a parasite private sector with a parasite public sector is an improvement. No guarantee that the state would be at all benevolent if people have no real choice but to accept the jobs offered. Harshness to the unemployed is politically popular."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:01;0;0;"yes they would, if the alternative is starvation (or relying on food banks, as Neil Wilson wants)."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 19:00;0;0;"But I am a bit tired of JG advocates fighting with UBI advocates. JG and UBI are entirely compatible. Indeed they need each other. We should work together, not fight each other."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:59;0;0;"it actually sets a wage floor in exactly the same way as an unsupported JG. If combined with JG, the JG wage would be higher."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:58;0;0;"you do know what the word "basic" means, yes?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:57;0;0;"Umm, "it could undermine a JG" is circular reasoning. If no-one would want to do the state-guaranteed jobs even for higher pay than the UBI, those jobs are not suitable for humans to do. Automate them and let people do fulfilling work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:56;0;1;"there is in fact substantial evidence that basic income schemes do work extremely well, especially in developing countries. I suggest you do some research."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:55;0;0;"there is no evidence whatsoever of that. Finland's experiment hasn't failed. There has been fake news saying that it had been terminated early."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:54;0;0;"Whatever you want to believe. Excuse me, but I have already said that this is unproductive time and I need to do some work. Goodbye."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:52;0;2;"I disagree with you. I think a basic income not only can be, but must be unconditional. It does not have to be inflationary, as you have asserted - there is plenty of evidence to the contrary."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:51;0;0;"I'd point out that in that quote, Bill is assuming the existence of a minimum wage - which I said earlier would be necessary to prevent employers undercutting the JG and forcing it down."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:50;0;0;"Yes there has. Not Bill, I agree. I will find the reference. I have to go now though. This discussion is unproductive time and I have to work for my living."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:49;0;0;"As I've already said I support a JG provided it is combined with an unconditional basic income (which of course is at a lower level than JG), I don't think your questions are relevant."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:48;0;0;"yes it has."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:47;1;3;"that is not basic income. Basic income is unconditional. Your "basic income" is conditional on accepting a state-provided job. You have misused the term to promote your own agenda."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:46;0;5;"This is workfare.https://twitter.com/neilwilson/status/991991497682767872 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:45;0;1;"That is the definition of workfare. "To receive benefits you must work"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:44;0;0;"I read the proposal. I even wrote about it. However, it was some years ago. The answer to the "crowding-out" criticism at that time was to set JG below the private sector wage level. When did this change, please, and how do you now propose to deal with crowding-out criticisms?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:42;0;0;"I won't support workfare, I'm afraid. It's a matter of principle. We have hit this rock before. I respect your principles, though I don't agree with them. I expect you to respect mine."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:41;0;0;"A choice between a state-guaranteed job and starvation is not a real choice. JG is workfare which you attempt to justify by appealing to "individual responsibility". But it's really the old mantra all over again - "those who will not work shall not eat"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:37;0;0;"The MMT proposal used to advise a JG wage below the private sector minimum to prevent crowding out. When was it changed?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:35;0;0;"If the choice is between a guaranteed job and starvation, JG is workfare."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:35;0;0;"Threatening me with legal action for using your surname when discussing your work is ridiculous. If I cited you in a Forbes article, I would use your surname. My editors would require it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:31;0;0;"Oh go away. You are being ridiculously petty. I used a standard form of communication, that is all."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:30;0;1;"Look I really don't need JG explained to me, thanks. I'm not opposed to it. I just don't see it as a panacea. I think it needs to be combined with other measures to prevent it becoming workfare at the margin."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:29;0;0;"umm no. The MMT scheme sets the JG wage below the private sector minimum to prevent crowding-out. Employers would have an incentive to cut private sector wages to the JG wage. You'd have to combine JG with a minimum wage for the private sector."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:27;0;0;"I have never, ever said that work is unnecessary or that it will disappear. Quite the contrary, in fact. You clearly aren't familiar with my work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:26;0;0;"I don't object to a JG. I just don't think it can be voluntary unless combined with a basic income. The "choice" between work and starvation is not a real choice. At the margin, if there is no basic income, JG is workfare."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:23;0;1;"I agree. The reason for Eurozone lowflation is concurrent fiscal tightening, in many causes due to the fiscal compact, but in Germany simply because they regard fiscal austerity as virtuous. QE is an inadequate response to a difficult political situation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:21;0;0;"I will use the standard convention, which is to use surnames. You don't have the right to tell me what to do."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:19;0;0;"It is a convention to use surnames. People often use my surname when discussing my work. Don't be so sensitive. And don't be rude."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:15;0;0;"When discussing academic work it's usual to use surnames. Didn't you know that?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:14;0;5;"Apparently it is fine for you to # mansplain JG to me, but if I dare to express an informed opinion, "nobody else can get a word in".

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:12;0;1;"So it's fine for you to mansplain JG to me, but how very dare I express an informed opinion based upon my own work? You patronising sod. Go away."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:10;0;0;"Why are you being rude? Am I not allowed to express an opinion on a subject about which I have been writing for over six years?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:09;0;0;"ugh."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:08;1;1;"The subprime sales were over a decade ago. Germany is not "in a mess"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:07;0;1;"ECB doesn't do QE for Germany's benefit, although Germany is the principal beneficiary. ECB is trying to raise inflation and growth in the Eurozone as a whole."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:05;0;0;"in fact the JG scheme proposed by MMT would pay a wage below the private sector average. It is one of my reservations about the scheme, since the employer of last resort undercutting the private sector creates an incentive for private sector employers to drive down wages."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:03;0;1;"Tcherneva is a serious academic and I have a lot of respect for her work. However, I do not agree that JG can be the primary macroeconomic stabiliser, and I am concerned about steep tapers and social stigma in JG schemes."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 18:02;0;1;"I have read their work and have serious reservations about it. Wilson's work in particular is biased by his belief in the moral imperative to work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 17:59;0;1;"I'm lampooning the article. Hence the hashtag. It's advertorial disguised as commentary."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 17:58;0;0;"the Jefes scheme that JG proponents often highlight as an example of a good JG scheme was introduced at a time of very high unemployment and poverty, so job refusal was virtually non-existent. The threat of starvation is an excellent coercive."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 17:55;0;0;"those who work tend to be the majority, so they wield political power. JG schemes may start with voluntary participation, but the resentment they tend to engender means that they inevitably become coercive and harsh."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 17:53;0;0;"I think it's not so much that people don't grasp the concept, as they don't like other people getting something for nothing. If people can refuse a guaranteed job and still be provided with the means to live, those who work for their living tend to get angry."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 17:51;1;1;"yes indeed. If refusing a guaranteed job means starvation, a job guarantee scheme is workfare."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 17:50;0;1;"Germany doesn't think it is in a mess. And the saving habit long pre-dates the subprime crisis."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 08:47;0;2;"Finding useful countercyclical work is the perennial difficulty in JG schemes. IMHO JG needs to be combined with increased public investment to ensure jobs add real value."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 08:43;0;0;"Even before workhouses, parish relief under the (English) Old Poor Laws often took the form of job guarantees. At the parish level, though, finding useful work for people to do was often a problem."
Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 08:41;0;3;"I also pointed out that workhouses were job guarantee schemes. Entering a workhouse was voluntary, but the alternative was starvation."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 08:34;0;2;"Yes. Important that the JG wage adds to UBI rather than replacing it. Withdrawal of unearned benefits is a serious disincentive to work."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 08:30;0;2;"Yes. I rarely see that said, sadly. Mostly, JG and UBI advocates seem to be at war with each other."

Frances_Coppola;2018-05-03 08:28;0;2;"Let me be clear. I don't see this as about "left" or "right" politics. I think JG needs to be combined with a basic income. Without basic income or equivalent, JG becomes workfare at the margin."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 03:08;0;0;"Yes, because I would want the reliefs to be extended to me. This is not trying to prevent 1950s women having help, it is saying that help that explicitly discriminates against others on age or sex grounds is unlawful.

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 03:04;0;2;"Yes exactly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 02:55;0;0;"You still aren't getting this. I don't support these recommendations. I said so at the meeting.

I don't expect them to be accepted as they stand, but if they were, I wd challenge legislation to enact them. That would not be the PMB, it would be new Govt legislation. Is this clear?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 02:42;0;0;"I'm perfectly happy for the Govt to conduct a review. I would expect that in that review, the APPG's recommendations would be amended to take account of legal obstacles such as the fact that they blatantly discriminate against women born early 1960 and men born in the 1950s."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 02:40;0;0;"No. You do not understand the PMB. All the APPG's Bill would do is force the Govt to conduct a comprehensive review of state pension arrangements for 1950s women, including the APPG's three recommendations. The PMB itself would not give 1950s women anything."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 02:38;0;0;"Of course. But this would be a prima facie case of age discrimination and an important test of the new legislation required to enact these recommendations. I would look for financial support to pursue the case."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 02:36;0;4;"This is NOT what I said. You have not understood the PMB. All it does is force the govt to conduct a review.

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 02:31;0;1;"If the review that the Govt would be compelled to conduct concluded that the APPG's recommendations should be accepted in their present form, and Parliament passed legislation to that effect, I would THEN launch a legal challenge on the grounds of age discrimination."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 01:02;0;1;"I support the proposed Bill bcs its aim is to force Govt to conduct a comprehensive review of state pension arrangements for 1950s women. I would expect that review to consider the possibility that enacting these recommendations could lead to legal action for discrimination."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-30 00:58;0;1;"Why is it "odd and spiteful" for me to point out that as the Bill's recommendations discriminate against me on grounds of age, I would take legal action personally if the Govt accepted them in their present form?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 05:10;0;0;"I just think this is hilarious. You've invented a fractional reserve banking system which issues a currency pegged to a foreign currency. The system has no reserves of that currency and relies entirely on a price adjustment mechanism to hold the exchange rate peg."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 05:07;0;0;"Why do you think that your price adjustment mechanism will be enough to maintain your exchange rate peg when a very similar price adjustment mechanism used by central banks is not enough?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 05:06;0;0;"History shows that an exchange rate peg not backed with reserves is extremely brittle, and when it breaks the currency goes into freefall. That's why emerging market countries have accumulated such large FX reserves. It's so they can support their currencies."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 05:04;0;0;"You then adjust the price of credit to maintain a 1:1 peg to the USD. The USD is therefore your anchor - your "reserve currency". But you don't have any USD reserves. You are just hoping that the price adjustment mechanism will be enough to stop the peg breaking."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 04:49;0;0;"Oh, and you charge interest on the loan too: "When the user wants to retrieve their collateral, they have to pay down the debt in the CDP, plus the Stability fee that continuously accrues on the debt over time". Is this compound interest?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 04:46;0;0;"If I have misunderstood this, please tell me how."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 04:45;0;0;"That is a perfect description of fractional reserve lending. CDP is an unregulated bank."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-25 04:44;0;0;"So the CDP gives the user newly created Dai in return for a new loan asset collateralized with pledged assets. The pledged assets are encumbered until the loan is discharged. When the loan is discharged, the Dai are destroyed."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-24 05:15;0;0;"I'm talking about since the crisis. Prior to the crisis, banks were doing far too much money creation, but it was asset prices that rose rather than CPI."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-24 05:03;0;1;"if the money supply were increasing faster than purchasing power, CPI inflation would be far higher than it is.

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-24 05:02;0;1;"But it isn't. The Fed doesn't create most of the money supply. Commercial banks do, and for much of the last decade they have not been doing much of it. The Fed compensated to some extent with QE but it wasn't enough."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-24 05:00;0;1;"yes exactly. That's where I think the focus should be. It's also why I am concerned about cryptocurrency "money" creation (faux US$ liabilities) and the illusion of Fed backing. The pre-crisis derivatives bubble formed in exactly the same way."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-24 04:51;0;1;"I think central banks made terrible mistakes before the crisis - that's why we had a crisis.

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:19;0;0;"You tweeted it publicly. You were bound to be challenged. Unfortunately you seem completely unable to cope with being challenged."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:17;0;0;"I just did. Lost on you, evidently."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:17;0;2;"So, when are you going to provide some real evidence for your claims?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:17;0;1;"Burden of proof rests with you, since you are the one making unsupported claims. I dismissed your personal evidence as inadequate - apart from anything else, it is not consistent with my own reality, and you don't have a monopoly on reality."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:14;0;0;"Umm no, I am challenging your assertions on the grounds that they do not conform with reality. I expect you to prove that they do. So far, you have produced no evidence."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:12;0;0;"And I don't want to talk about music with you, because you'll probably claim to be an expert in that too and tell me that baby boomers don't understand contemporary music. Yawn."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:11;0;0;"You don't even know what I've posted about myself, if all you know about me is that I worked in banking and did some music."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:10;0;0;"You made general assertions about baby boomers based on your personal experience. I challenged the validity of those general assertions. You have provided no evidence to support them. Personal experience cannot support a generalisation."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:09;0;0;"And dismissing statistics that don't conform with your personal experience is just pathetic, frankly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:08;0;0;"Your personal experience is not evidence. Relying on that alone is called "generalising from the particular" and is a form of fallacious argument."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:07;0;0;"I challenged your assertions. Burden of proof rests with you. Personal experience is not evidence of a widespread effect."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:05;0;0;"You don't know much about me if all you know is that I "worked in banking". I say you are talking rubbish."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:04;0;0;"This is more rubbish. The youngest baby boomers were in their 20s in the early 1990s. Gen X were only slightly younger. At work, there wasn't much difference. You really are talking nonsense."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:03;0;0;"Your own personal experience is not evidence."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 06:03;0;0;"You haven't done any homework on anything. Where's your evidence to back up the statements you have made?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:51;0;0;"yes, you really are wrong."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:50;0;0;"it's nonsense and you know it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:50;0;0;"You are a radio presenter. You aren't an expert on anything."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:49;0;0;"I don't know why you are so determined to cling to your belief that younger baby boomers are much less tech-savvy than Gen X, but it is completely untrue."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:48;0;0;"It really isn't fact. It is obviously nonsensical to say someone in their 30s was not involved with tech in their working lives to the same extent as someone in their 20s. Tech affected everyone."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:47;0;0;"I did not cite @ resfoundation on real estate. I cited their findings on inequality in the baby boomer cohort. Are you claiming to be an expert on that too?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:43;0;0;"I know that. I am not talking about pensions. My criticism is about your judgment of baby boomers regarding their knowledge and use of tech. You are very wrong about that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:42;0;0;"And my comments about tech are that you don't know what you are talking about if you think that people who were in their 30s in the 1990s somehow had a "different relationship" with tech from those in their 20s. Divisive nonsense."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:40;0;1;"I have not misunderstood your comments about tech. You claimed that the 20-something Gen X-ers in the 1990s rolled out the tech of that time, but the baby boomers only slightly older weren't involved. Utter garbage."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:39;0;0;"Yes, I cite @ resfoundation. At least they do research, unlike you. It's a bit rich for someone who has not provided a scrap of evidence to support his statements to claim that a well-respected research foundation is "ill-informed"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:37;0;0;"You are clearly aggrieved that many (not all) baby boomers will get better pensions than you."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:35;0;0;"Insulting me doesn't change the facts, I'm afraid. In this convo, there is not a scrap of evidence from you. But I corrected your maths, and there are numerous links from another person which debunk your erroneous statements about baby boomers and tech."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:33;0;0;"I do not dispute that. The challenge I issued was over your statements about tech, not about pensions. However, it is worth noting that not all baby boomers will have generous pensions. There is wide inequality in that group - see @ resfoundation's research."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:27;0;0;"tbh it is not at all clear what your point is, apart from you feeling aggrieved that older baby boomers have better pensions than you. They also have better pensions than younger baby boomers. So what."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:25;0;0;"You don't know the whole of the baby boomer generation. Your personal experience is not evidence."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:25;0;0;"Oh, and pension reforms have absolutely nothing to do with your ridiculous assertion that baby boomers weren't involved in the rollout of tech in the 1990s."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:23;0;0;"You are generalising from personal experience. That is meaningless. You don't know the whole of the baby boomer generation, and your statements about them are factually incorrect, as others have shown."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:22;0;0;"Your points are a) mathematically wrong, as I have shown b) historically inaccurate c) illogical. You have not produced a shred of evidence to support your statements. Others, however, have produced substantial evidence that you are wrong."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 05:20;0;0;"No it doesn't. You are making this up to support your silly argument that somehow people classed as "Generation X" are fundamentally different from those only a few days older than them. It is bollocks and you know it."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 01:08;0;0;"You really don't know what you are talking about. Most baby boomers are now in their 50s and 60s, not 70+. And they did lead the change we see today. Suggest you go and learn some maths, and some history."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 01:06;0;0;"in fact as the "baby boom" lasted till 1965, the youngest baby boomers were still in their 20s in the first half of the 1990s. "Older generation"? Hardly. Maths isn't your strong point, is it?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 01:03;0;1;"Your experience clearly isn't extensive or you wouldn't talk such absolute nonsense. Suggest you take the "I hate baby boomers" chip off your shoulder."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 01:02;0;0;"The "older generation" at the time you are talking about were the silent generation. The younger baby boomers were only in their 30s, for heaven's sake. You are being very silly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 00:55;0;1;"You just had a lazy boss, I reckon. Don't generalise from your own experience."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-21 00:54;0;0;"I'm afraid it is you who are being silly. A baby boomer born in 1955 was 40 in 1995. They used tech every bit as much as the Gen X 25-year olds in their team. A boss aged 50 might not have done, but he wasn't a baby boomer. He was born in 1945, so from the silent generation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-20 23:52;0;2;"Also, of course, baby boomers were in the workplace in the 1990s. In fact they were the senior managers at that time. Gen X, being younger, were more junior. It's frankly a bit hilarious to claim that baby boomers at the peak of their careers had nothing to do with tech rollout."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-20 16:58;0;0;"No. A much larger number than you realise. Tech was ubiquitous for the younger baby boomers in particular, the ones who started work in the late 1970s/early 1980s. The 1980s were boom years for tech change. They, not Gen X, drove that change."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 01:06;0;1;"Why are we obsessed with money supply? Surely it is outcomes that matter. If a central bank achieves its mandate over the medium term, the absolute money supply is irrelevant."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 01:04;0;0;"I don't agree. Since 1992, when they adopted inflation targeting, most central banks have achieved their mandate over the medium-term, or been slightly below it. But central bank money is not stable versus gold."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 01:02;0;1;"no they wouldn't. Stability does not mean zero inflation. If the anchor was deflationary, then central banks could choose an inflation target that accommodated that. Absolutely no need to guarantee fixed supply."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 01:00;0;0;"I said "appears to be". Every Bitcoiner I have ever spoken to is strongly opposed to credit. But it may be that P2P BTC lending will take off. ICOs are not credit, and cloud mining involves no financial credit (it is essentially hardware leasing)."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:45;0;0;"Dear god. No they aren't. Visa and Mastercard don't just handle CC payments. You've never heard of debit cards? And then there are Fedwire, CHAPS, Target2. Even ACH does international payments to quite a lot of countries these days."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:41;0;0;"Really. Where are the BTC lenders, then? And not all businesses have cash floats. Many don't need them. I run a small business, and I don't have a cash float. I'm paid by direct transfer to my bank account."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:36;1;1;"Bitcoin is an entirely pre-funded system. LN requires funds to be tied up in "channels" which are effectively escrow accounts. There is no "credit" in Bitcoin except on exchanges or between individuals if they so choose."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:27;0;0;"Credit card payment service providers (AMEX, Visa, Mastercard) weren't bailed out. Banks are card issuers but don't process the payments."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:27;0;0;"The locked-up liquidity is in Bitcoin, which works entirely on escrow. I have yet to see any estimates of the cost to merchants of having large amounts of money tied up in escrow accounts."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:18;0;0;"but you should not be comparing Bitcoin with credit cards anyway. Bitcoin is an escrow system - you have to have funds available in order to pay.

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:14;0;0;"the only ones that take longer are those where a very small retailer has no card reader so uses an intermediary to process credit card slips. This is changing as card readers become cheaper & more accessible for small businesses."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:13;0;0;"if merchants choose to batch transactions, that is their decision."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:12;0;0;"think you are confusing the interest-free period on an AMEX corporate card with the settlement time to the merchant. Not the same thing."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:11;0;0;"No they don't. I write professionally for AMEX. I know how they work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:10;0;0;"one of the principal reasons is that merchants themselves batch transactions."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:08;0;0;"Here in the UK, settlement times are typically 24 hours to three days. I suggest you read the reasons for that.https://www.creditcardprocessing.com/2013/12/long-take-merchant-receive-funds/ …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-17 00:06;0;0;"No credit card system on earth waits to reimburse merchants until it has received funds from the user. It wouldn't be a credit card if it did that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 23:56;0;0;"Yes they are. Not the corrupt "state capitalism" that is all that has ever been achieved, but the atomic people's power that arises from the dialectical conflict in pure Marxism."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 23:54;0;0;"The periodic nature of salary, tax and rent payments is unlikely to change because employers, tax authorities and landlords like the certainty, though they could now be processed at any time. Merchant payments are what matter, and as you point out, they are already instant."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 23:51;0;1;"No. It was my own suggestion. But we seem to be a long way away from that now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:49;0;0;"You are clearly unaware of how payment systems in Europe work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:48;0;0;"the fact is that everything is measured in USD. USD is the unit of account. It is more entrenched now as UoA in the crypto world than it was in 2013. Imho the serious challenger to USD as UoA could be ETH, not BTC."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:43;0;0;"you talk as if the existing payments systems are somehow set in stone and stuck back in the last century. They aren't. Update yourself."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:42;0;0;"In Europe, card and online payments settle within seconds. The UK has had fast 24/7 payments for nearly a decade now. America is lagging behind - ACH is only rolling out same-day payments now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:39;0;0;"Modern payments systems have not been around for "centuries", nor even for 90 years. Point-of-sale cards processing was introduced in the late 1980s, along with telephone banking. Online and mobile banking are more recent."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:29;0;0;"Bitcoiner assumption that establishing Bitcoin as a long-term SoV will necessarily mean it will be adopted as a mainstream MoE is fundamentally flawed imho."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:28;0;0;"It's not the UoA. USD is. That's why everything is measured in USD, including BTC's value. And an effective SoV is usually a poor MoE, because good SoVs are typically illiquid."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:26;0;0;"Absolutely."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:25;0;0;"Fact is that it is unacceptable to fail a payment for someone who has funds available. No mainstream system would do this. LN expects people to tie up funds in channels with no guarantee they could use them for payment when they wanted. No-one in their right mind would do this."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:23;0;0;"No they don't. You are WAY out of date. Mainstream payments systems operate 24/7 now. No way would a system that told someone trying to pay for their meal in a restaurant on Saturday night to "wait till Monday" be remotely acceptable now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:20;0;0;"It is not the only cryptocurrency to offer this. Nor even the best."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:19;0;0;"I am certainly not ignorant of network effects. Don't dish out ad hominems. Imho the really interesting research in the cryptocurrency space right now is outside BTC. This will remain the case while BTC is in thrall to monetary cranks. It has gone down a blind alley."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:14;0;0;"2) Bitcoin's scaling problems will eventually solved: this is an article of faith for which as yet there is no evidence whatsoever. I am personally of the opinion that LN will neither scale nor be reliable as a means of payments."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:13;0;0;"your argument is 1) that everyone values censorship resistance and trust-free exchange highly: I disagree, and I also think Bitcoin doesn't really offer this anyway"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:11;0;0;"He seemed to think the problem would solve itself once LN was "mature". Like people will continue to use it if they can't pay their bills because "no route" # facepalm."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:09;0;1;"that rather assumes a sufficiently large network, of course"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:06;0;0;"I suspect that if it were not for the Austrian economic cranks using Bitcoin as a vehicle to promote their world view, Bitcoin would now be on its way out."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:04;0;0;"Yes. I don't have a problem with privacy coins. I defend their right to exist. They have a real-world use. I might not like that use, but I don't have the right to censor. My problem is Bitcoin. I don't see the point any more."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 22:02;0;1;"no. The people you transact with are always the same. The pathfinding protocol "hops" payments from channel to channel so that you can make payments to people with whom you have no channel. Wouldn't exactly be difficult to work out the paths used."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:53;0;1;"No, I wouldn't. I think the fact that the only metric is the market value is evidence that Bitcoin has lost its soul. All that matters now is making money (in USD). Comments like "You're broke and we are rich" "You are bitter because you didn't buy the dip" say it all."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:51;0;2;""Bitcoin is just like the internet". Alternatively, it might be just like the Sinclair C5."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:49;0;0;"As all the transactions in the channel are between the same parties, and the on-chain broadcast can be linked to those parties, the anonymity of individual transactions is pointless."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:46;0;0;"I know. I'm probably going to be burned at the stake."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:45;0;1;"Indeed, the whole idea that Bitcoin should be, and will inevitably become, a monopoly hardly shows commitment to free markets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:44;0;0;"no they can't. LN channel opening and closing is broadcast to the main chain. When that happens, it can be linked to its originators, just like all other on-chain transactions."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:42;0;1;"and now dedicated Bitcoiners are claiming that Bitcoin was never anonymous. They've changed their tune."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:41;0;2;"one of Bitcoin's principal selling points in its early years was anonymity. I was there, and I saw the claims that were being made for it. Once it became apparent that Bitcoin transactions could be linked to their originators, the claims of anonymity stopped."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:40;0;1;"As it stands, LN cannot guarantee to make payments at all, let alone in seconds."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:39;0;1;"fact is, Bitcoiners can't come up with a solution to the scaling problem that doesn't involve taking more and more off chain, because the incentives structure doesn't value liquidity."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:37;0;1;"Umm, Satoshi's paper never envisages taking smaller payments off chain. That is a subsequent development that emerged out of Bitcoin's evident failure to cope with significant volumes."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:35;1;0;"I was stunned when in a conversation with a LN dev recently, he said that payments would simply fail if no payment route could be found, even though the payer had funds. He didn't think this mattered. I beg to differ."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:34;1;0;"I said that there needs to be a means of intermediating savings into productive investment, and there needs to be reliable liquidity for transactions. Without those, Bitcoin is a non-starter as a mainstream economic and monetary system."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 21:27;0;0;"it is also how money has been created throughout history, including under gold standards. In fact gold standards have generally been more coercive than fiat systems, probably because state power is usually stronger under gold standards."

In fact if you want to look at a money supply increase that should have been inflationary, see 2000-2006 in Western economies. Huge increase in M2/3, but stable CPI. But there was inflation...."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:45;0;0;"V is often seen as a residual, but in a recession it is rather more active. When spending crashes, the velocity of money slows considerably. Unless M increases, Y and/or P necessarily fall. This is simple arithmetic."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:41;0;0;"Furthermore, we know that the other two terms in the MV=PY equation can also change. Y is GDP. It crashed in 2008 along with broad M. Topping up M with QE wasn't enough to stop Y falling, let alone cause prices to rise. That was in large part because V collapsed."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:38;0;0;"If you want to see what happens when private money collapses and the central bank DOESN'T step in to compensate with public money, go look at Greece."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:37;0;0;"In the bank crisis, M (broadly defined) actually fell, a lot. QE topped it up to some extent, thus preventing a major depression due to money supply collapse as happened in the 1930s."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:34;0;0;"So a better measure of money in the MV=PY equation is M2, which includes the bank deposits and other forms of credit that most people use as money. Problem is that means accepting that bank credit can be money, contrary to Austrian economics."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:31;0;2;"The trouble is that in advanced countries today, physical cash is only about 3% of money in circulation. And because of QE, banks have more reserves than they need to settle deposit withdrawals. Money multiplier is broken.(It never really existed anyway, but that's another story)"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:28;0;1;"If we use M0 (physical cash + bank reserves), we are assuming 1) physical cash is a significant proportion of money in circulation 2) there is a direct relationship between bank reserved and purchasing power, what we usually call the "money multiplier""
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:26;0;0;"However, the definition of M is complicated by the fact that there are several measures of M. Which one to use?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:24;0;1;"If we take the standard "quantity theory of money", MV=PY, clearly if Y and V remain unchanged, P will increase if M increases. This is the assumption made by those who equate inflation with money supply increase."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 16:22;0;1;"It's clear however that you don't understand what the "money supply" is, nor what inflation is. M0 is not the money supply. And inflation is not, and never has been, simply increase in M0, except in the imagination of Austrian economists."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 07:04;0;1;"I really did want that second baby. And no c-section."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 07:03;0;4;"Oh, it does that frequently."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 06:59;0;1;"Wasn't easy - 23 hours of induced labour and a ventouse delivery. But absolutely no regrets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 06:58;0;1;"Hah. Consultant booked me in for elective C-section on his day off. Junior docs are no match for a formidable senior sister. They never stood a chance."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 06:49;0;0;"I had two. But the medical profession gave me the runaround with my second. Consultant tried to bully me into another C-section. I armed myself with a very influential friend - senior sister in a neonatal unit at a different hospital. It worked. Doctors backed down."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 06:40;0;1;"Just shows how quickly things can go off the rails."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 06:25;0;1;"When I came round from the anaesthetic, the midwife told me "another 5 minutes and we would have lost him". It was that close. He was very blue, spent 3 days in special care."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 06:19;0;3;"The story of my son's birth is similar to the piece I tweeted, except that he survived (just). Undiagnosed pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, emergency C-section, baby with IUGR. I remember being treated like an object by the ob/gyn surgeon, whom I had never met."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 06:12;0;0;"I did. I'd call it medical negligence, personally. She had a known risk factor for which she was inadequately monitored. Race may well have been a factor, but negligence is still negligence."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-16 05:45;2;3;"So very sad.

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-15 04:06;0;0;"That makes sense. I've been aware for quite some time that what the ICO is ostensibly for is of much less importance than the token sale itself."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-15 04:04;0;0;"HODLers hoard coins, and ICOs create new ones, which pumps the BTC and ETH price thus encouraging more HODLing and more ICOs. I think it is similar to the offshore USD bubble in the 2000s. Underlying belief is that USD will always be available for cashing out."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-15 03:59;0;0;"I'm trying to work out in my head what the link between HODLers and ICOs is. In a conventional monetary system, saving (HODLing) is intermediated into investing. Accounting identiy S=I. But doesn't seem to work quite like that here."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-15 03:56;0;0;"So the fact that the funds are in BTC and ETH misses the point. There's an underlying USD anchor (or equivalent)."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-15 03:43;0;0;"But the employees have to eat. So they must cash out."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-15 03:39;0;0;"So underpinning the ICO phenomenon is a tacit faith that they will always be able to cash out into fiat. There's an implied USD anchor."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-15 03:35;5;2;"If an ICO raises funds in BTC or ETH, presumably it cashes out into USD or another fiat currency in order to use them?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:48;0;0;"Quantity theory of money: MV=PY where M=money supply, V=velocity of money, P=general price level for goods & services, Y=production of goods & services (for fiat currency this approximates to GDP)"
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:47;0;0;"That is a meaningless definition of inflation for practical purposes. The useful definition is a general rise in the prices of goods and services. That, of course, is a function of supply and demand."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:46;0;1;"I agree with Puffles."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:45;1;2;"it is necessary for a medium of exchange to be stable in value over time (no wild swings in value) because otherwise it becomes very difficult to use for transactions. But that does not have to mean zero inflation, let alone actual deflation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:43;1;3;"Yes, it's a zero-coupon perpetual bearer bond. It is not protected from inflation and has zero yield. You do not have the right to demand that the issuer protects its value over time, if the issuer's purpose is to facilitate transactions rather than provide you with an asset."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:41;0;2;"No. This is about incentives not friction. If people are incentivised to hoard rather than spend, the "moneyness" of the asset declines as its price rises."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:39;0;0;"no it isn't. Inflation is a function of supply vs demand, not absolute supply. When demand increases faster than supply, as it did in the second half of 2017, Bitcoin is deflationary. Direction of BTC price trend indicates inflation/deflation."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:32;1;10;"HODLing BTC drives up its price and increases its scarcity, making it less and less useful for transactions. Hence BCH and other altcoins. Not clear to me why people would use a clunky system like LN for transactions in preference to, say, BCH or LTC."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:29;2;10;"In the case of Bitcoin, "near-moneys" are now proliferating. Bitcoin maximalists cling to the faith that these near-moneys will eventually die, because y'know Bitcoin (being deflationary) is SOO much better. But Gresham's Law says otherwise."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:22;4;7;"lWhen "money" is no longer used for transactions, its value is some function of its scarcity, desirability and residual liquidity. A completely illiquid asset is worthless."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:20;1;8;"When "money" becomes less useful as a medium of exchange, because of scarcity and associated price rises, people create other near-moneys to use for transactions. If deflation in the main "money" continues, eventually people stop using it for transactions."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:17;2;17;"When something called "money" is desired primarily as a long-term store of value, and therefore hoarded, causing its price to rise, its usefulness as a medium of exchange inevitably declines."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:07;0;3;"If you need yield, you don't want money, you want assets. Money's purpose is transactions. It needs to hold value over the short-term, and it needs to be stable over the medium term, but it does not need to deliver positive yield."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:06;0;0;"I've read Nick Szabo. I don't agree with him. And I don't need you to educate me about the purpose of money, thanks."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:05;0;0;"Nor do you have the right to demand that there is zero inflation over the long term simply because you want to hold cash as an asset for the long term. Cash is not designed to be used in such a way. Its purpose is transaction, not hoarding."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:03;0;0;"You are still confusing "money" and "assets". You may choose to hold money as an asset, thus foregoing any chance of making a positive return. You do not have the right to demand that money becomes deflationary in order to deliver the positive return that you want."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:02;0;0;"price stability as operated by central banks does not mean no price increases, it means little volatility in prices. A gentle upwards rise in prices over the medium-term meets this definition of price stability. The wild price swings of cryptocurrencies do not."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 20:00;0;1;"Money needs to be a store of value in the short term, because otherwise transactions are impossible. It does not need to be a long-term store of value, let alone one whose value appreciates. That is what other assets are for."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 19:56;0;0;"This is what I mean by confusion. You are saving in bitcoins as a long-term asset, but you talk about them as if they are money even though you are not using them as money."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 19:55;0;0;"Then they aren't money. They are assets. The whole purpose of money is to facilitate transactions - i.e. to be spent."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-09 19:54;0;0;"You are still making the same mistake. People don't "hold" money, except in times of severe economic distress (which are usually mercifully brief). They spend money, and hold assets. And spending BTC is becoming ever more difficult. You should read up on Gresham's Law."

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-07 17:31;0;2;"Since we don't know what stocks there are in the earth, it is illogical and unsafe to assert that there could be an increase in copper production sufficient to depress prices, but that gold production can only ever be small."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-07 17:30;0;4;"There is no reason to assume that a large increase in gold mining would not have a similar effect. You assume gold mining can only ever be small.

Frances_Coppola;2018-04-07 16:30;11;21;"And when QE, which benefits the rich, is combined with excessively tight fiscal policy explicitly intended to hurt the young and poor, the result is an asset price boom coupled with very low inflation or even deflation, inadequate productive investment, and little income growth."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-07 16:25;10;23;"The real problem with QE is that it principally raised asset prices, benefiting the rich, rather than providing funds for small business investment and endowments to the young people and families whose lives were blighted by the crash. As a reflationary tool, it was weak."
Frances_Coppola;2018-04-07 16:20;5;14;"As the people of Equatorial Guinea know, by far the best way of preventing inflation is to ensure that most people never get more than a dollar a day.

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-18 19:03;0;2;"DWP research in 2004 found that although the majority of women knew SPA was rising, and a significant proportion knew their actual SPA, poorer and less educated women were much less likely to know. This is partly why I support a means tested solution."

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:43;0;1;"Good point. Also businesses dependent on leased property. Despite the scary debt figures, the Bloomberg piece showed US retail malaise is more about real estate than PE debt."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:40;0;2;"Do you always talk such nonsense? State pension is well below the personal tax threshold, you berk. You aren't going to be taxed on it. Ever."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:38;0;1;"Yep, short term ownership inevitably means short term outlook!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:36;0;1;"I'd agree with that. Also PE owners can drive a business to over-expand at price of USPs. IMHO this is what happened to Maplin."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:34;0;1;"They can do, yes. Increases fragility. But taking on debt to pay divis is not limited to PE-owned companies. Public companies do too because of effect on share price of withholding dividend. Carillion repeatedly borrowed to pay divis."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:24;0;2;"At a secondary level, yes. If biz can't refinance, PE owner will sell the business, or failing that close it down. But that's not the same as saying shareholders' lending causes the company to fail. It doesn't. If a PE-owned company fails due to debt, it is external debt."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:07;0;0;"IMHO for PE-owned companies the cash position is way more informative than headline debt."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 17:05;0;0;"To be fair, the piece isn't the worst. There's a Bloomberg piece that gives scary headline debt figures for lots of US retailers but doesn't analyse the debt or identify the real risks. Misleading."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 16:59;0;0;"But meda reports often don't distinguish between shareholders' funding and external debt. They just use the total figure, which looks terrible but doesn't really tell us much."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 16:53;0;0;"Kind of my point. Headline debt is a mixture of borrowing from external sources, which is subject to conditions and can be called, and shareholders' funding, which is really equity. It's the external borrowing that matters."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-17 13:25;2;6;"Interesting piece, though IMHO slightly confused about private equity ownership - headline debt is symptom not cause, real issue is PE owners' demand for high short-term returns at expense of long-term biz survival.

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-05 19:25;0;0;"Actually no, just read your tweet more carefully. NI is fully hypothecated. No leakage to general govt spending, contrary to popular opinion. I agree it's a register of eligibility though."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-05 19:23;0;0;"I don't really care whether you agree with it. The principle of taxation is burden-sharing. Richer people contribute more so that everyone's needs are met. No reasaon whatsoever to exempt property owning pensioners from this principle."

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-03 21:34;0;0;"we do know that the over-75 cohort of women were the first generation of women among whom smoking was widespread, and many were reluctant to give up when scientific evidence of health damage started to appear in the 1950s."

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-03 20:00;2;2;"It has actually fallen. But the fall is among low-income elderly women, not little girls from low-income families.

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:52;0;0;"Raising women's state pension age to 65 does not qualify as a "longevity" rise. It is simply the fairest form of equalisation, since it avoids gross injustice to older men. The state pension age for men has been 65 since 1925."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:48;0;0;"With respect, I follow this issue a lot, and I routinely talk to people whose job it is to analyse longevity statistics. There is zero evidence that the small rises in state pension age that have been legislated so far will have any impact on longevity."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:43;1;0;"I remind you that the state pension age for women was 65 from 1925 to 1940. Reducing it to 60 was a cheapskate way of increasing the household incomes of retired men with younger wives at a time when only about 10% of married women worked. It is wholly unjustifiable now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:41;0;0;"As I've already pointed out, that would have been grossly unfair to older men who had to work to 65. There is no reason why women can't work for as long as men, and no justification whatsoever for reducing the state pension age of younger men without compensating older ones."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:39;0;0;"Nit picking. The ECB pulled the plug. That's what matters. I've corrected the one error you've identified. I'm not going to make any further changes to my article."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:38;0;0;"the state pension now is not about poor relief. It is a universal contributory benefit. Has been since 1925."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:38;0;0;"Erm, the state pension age under the original Poor Law pension was 70 for both men and women, at a time when not many of the poor made it to that age. It was also non-contributory and heavily means and character tested. We are far more generous now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:36;1;1;"I agree with you that the state pension is regressive, because richer people receive more over their lifetimes. But that applies equally to men and women. Low-income men have considerably shorter lives than high-income men. They also have shorter lives than low-income women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:34;0;0;"Women born 1950-1979 have had rises of up to 5 years in state pension age in order to equalise their state pension age with that of men. They have additionally had the same longevity rises as men. So women born Oct 1954-Apr 1960 now have SPA of 66, the same as men of their age."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:33;0;0;"I have already pointed out that no woman has had a state pension age increase of 6 years due to rising longevity. Men and women have had state pension age increases of 1-3 years due to rising longevity, with the youngest having the largest increase."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:31;0;0;"Yes. And the ECB could have prevented the Latvian central bank providing ELA, which would have forced the bank to close. It has that power. So my question is why it didn't. Do you agree that was a reasonable point to make?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:29;0;0;"Nor is there any evidence whatsoever from these charts that increasing state pension age reduces longevity, as you are alleging. Longevity reduction for the 65-69 cohort is the lowest of all. The big fall is among the very oldest pensioners."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:28;0;4;"The 1950-53 cohort is of course represented on this chart, and on the similar one for men further down the thread. But younger low-income women and men are not represented. We do not know if their longevity is similarly falling. Please don't abuse statistics."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 21:25;0;1;"I agree that support is needed for women and men who face financial hardship due to state pension changes.

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 18:18;0;1;"No, you are demanding special treatment for a particular group of women, and misusing what are by any standards very worrying statistics about much older women to support that wholly unreasonable demand."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 18:06;0;4;"There was no haste. The rise of up to 5 years was announced in 1993 and legislated in 1995. Women had ample time to prepare. Anyway, if low-income men can work till 65, why can't low-income women? Not all men have private/works pensions."

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 18:02;0;0;"Rubbish. The new state pension is considerably more generous than what these pensioners are living on. And the problem is not pensions anyway. It's underfunding of social care and withdrawal of support services. See Marmot on this."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 18:00;1;1;"I think it is frankly disgraceful to use the evidence that life expectancy is crashing among the oldest low-income pensioners to support a demand for reversal of a necessary and sensible rise in state pension age for women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 17:57;1;1;"Also, older pensioners - men as well as women - have lower state pensions than those retiring now. Pension credit is means tested, and many old people don't take up means-tested benefits. Many of the oldest pensioners live in poverty, made worse by underfunding of care services."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-02 17:51;0;1;"But otherwise I broadly agree with Julian's critique. He slightly undermines his argument in the third point, though. He is confident that # Brexit will bring gains, so why argue that higher spending is a bad idea because of Brexit?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:36;0;0;"Yes, this is the conclusion I have come to. Rutland was pretty generous - 15% on mezz debt in a turnaround from insolvency is not particularly high, and they paid more than they should imho (£14.7m after debt settlement). But the stores strategy is clearly wrong for a tech co."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:33;0;0;"they only get dividends if the business turns in a profit after paying the interest charge on their loans, i.e. if their returns exceed expectations. As I said, the interest rate can be seen as a benchmark or target return."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:29;0;0;"no, it's a substitute. They don't get dividends, they get interest on loans. Shareholders' deficit reflects the extent to which returns disappoint. May or may not be an actual loss."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:28;0;0;"if you are right, then 15% on shareholder loans is low. Part of my general thesis that Rutland underestimated the risk they were taking on. Paid too much and didn't set a high enough target."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:27;0;0;"Yes, that's what I was thinking. That's why comparing the interest charge on shareholders' loans with bank loans is inappropriate. This was a risky turnaround. Company could not have obtained senior debt on that scale."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:20;0;0;"Of course. It utilises the tax shield on debt. But the interest substitutes for expected shareholders' returns, that's my point."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:18;0;0;"Think it depends on the VC company. Montagu is a vampire imho. Graphite, not so much. Personally I wouldn't be so hard on Rutland. It was trying to turn it round, and almost succeeded."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:09;0;2;"So if interest rate on shareholders' loans is 15%, and the business records a loss solely due to the interest charge at that rate, the loss indicates the amount by which returns are falling short of shareholders' expectations."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:06;1;1;"Thinking about it, the VC model is merely a way of measuring shareholder returns against expectations, isn't it? Interest rate on shareholders' loans reflects return shareholders expect from the business."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:02;0;0;"When it was owned by Graphite it was making a profit. Imho it was Montagu (which bought it in 2004), not Rutland, that drained the company."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 06:00;0;0;"I mean Montagu, not Graphite. Montagu acquired Maplin in 2004. Accounting is the VC model - cost of acquisition on the acquired company's balance sheet as debt. Maplin Holdings made a loss every year from 2004 onwards. Was deeply insolvent by 2012. Montagu ditched it in 2014."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:40;0;0;"I agree. They neglected their key online offering in favour of expensive and unnecessary stores imho. Still opening new ones even when the company was going down. Madness."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:39;0;0;"It's not that simple. And I don't respond to ad hominems."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:38;0;0;"clearly Graphite wasn't prepared to contribute any more capital, so it sold it at a significant discount to its original purchase price. I guess this is why I am saying the model isn't the fundamental problem. It would have been insolvent in a conventional shareholder model too."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:36;0;0;"Richard, the 2014 accounts reveal that the company was deeply insolvent in 2012 (it was owned by Graphite then). No accounts filed in 2013. 2014 accounts show it was recapitalised in 2014 with a debt for equity swap, but that wasn't enough to return it to solvency."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:27;0;0;"Maplin opened a new store about 5 minutes away from where I live shortly before Christmas. I had a look round, but I wasn't impressed. I remember thinking "what is the point of this?" Didn't know the company was in trouble though."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:25;0;0;"yes. I must admit, I struggled to see the point of the stores. Nice playground, but far too expensive and insufficient footfall. And meant they were far too slow to develop their online offering."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:23;0;0;"Looks that way. Imho Rutland paid too much for it, given the depth of its insolvency in 2014. Hoping to ride the tech wave, I'd say. In 2014 tech investments did look good, but things are changing now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:21;0;0;"yes indeed. But the source is back in previous filing history. Maplin was insolvent in 2014. Rutland rescued it - imho paid rather a lot for it in the circumstances."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:18;0;0;"yes."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:18;0;0;"I know about the mirror trades. You don't read my work, do you? I've written about them."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:18;0;0;"Certainly not a bank. Shareholders' loan notes - principal shareholder is a VC. I've had a look back through the filing history now. Rutland bought an insolvent company. Shareholders' loan notes must be mezzanine."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:15;0;0;"Think that's a trifle unfair. US regulators have repeatedly fined Deutsche Bank for all sorts of offences. But it is much bigger than ABLV and more resilient."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:13;0;1;"I'm not necessarily defending the model, but I think you have to look at where the problems really arose. Maplin was horribly overstretched in 2014. Chances of the turnaround failing were pretty high imho. Rutland had to put in a lot of capital and risked losing it all."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:09;1;3;"Maplin stayed alive three years longer than it would have done if Rutland had not bought it. Have you seen the 2014 accounts prior to the sale? It was insolvent."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:08;0;0;"btw that is Danske Bank not Deutsche Bank"
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:07;0;0;"comparison with interest rate on bank loans is inappropriate if shareholders' loan notes are mezzanine, obviously. Bank loans are senior debt."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:06;0;0;"I agree 15% return is high, but this was a turnaround after near-failure in 2014. Haven't seen the structure of the shareholders' loan notes, but given the circumstances they are probably mezzanine. If so, interest rate is arguably justifiably high."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:01;0;0;"I've been asking that question for years."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 05:00;0;0;"I'd say it massively overstretched itself in the years running up to its 2014 collapse. Was sold to Rutland by its VC owner Graphite as an alternative to insolvency. Rutland's job was to turn it round. Rescuing failing firms is a risky business, hence the high interest rate?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 04:57;0;0;"I've been looking back through the filing history. Maplin nearly failed in 2014. Rutland rescued it. But it's been in VC ownership for a very long time. Hard to say that VC ownership itself is the problem, as @ RichardJMurphy says."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 04:13;0;0;"Mezzanine debt would explain the high interest rate. But it's odd for a company's debt to be entirely mezzanine except for bank loans."
Frances_Coppola;2018-03-01 04:11;0;0;"think you'll find that has very little to do with it."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-28 23:01;0;1;"What is the "WASPI period", please? Women born in the 1960s and 70s have had larger SPA rises than those born in the 1950s.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-28 22:53;0;0;"I am struggling to see how giving 1950s women pensions from 60 while raising 1950s men's SPA to 66 implements any sort of equality."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-28 22:50;0;0;"So you see, my objections are not about money. They are about legality, equality and fairness. I regard the # WASPI demand as immoral."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-28 22:49;0;0;"The # WASPI demand would also give money to some of the very rich, rather than taxing them. It is highly regressive."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-28 22:48;0;3;"Women born in the 1960s and 70s have had larger SPA rises than the # WASPI women, and the vast majority have never been notified of those rises. It is hard to justify compensating the 1950s cohort but not these women. But if these women are also compensated, where does it end?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-28 22:47;0;0;"The # WASPI demand is also grossly unfair to younger people. Women born January 1960, for example, would face an effective 6-year rise in SPA relative to women just a few days older. That is a larger difference than faced by any 1950s women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-28 22:46;0;2;"The # WASPI demand as it stands is illegal under the Equalities Act, because it reinstates discrimination against men that was ended in the 1995 Pensions Act."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:44;1;0;"Subsequent events do show that he was right to complain about the nature of the HFC Bank contract, although there is considerable difference of opinion about the scale of overcharging."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:37;0;0;"He does reveal that the employer refused to discuss the legality or otherwise of the HFC Bank contract at the mediation hearing."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:36;0;0;"There was a mediated settlement of his employment dispute, the nature of which he does not reveal as it is covered by a confidentiality agreement. It did not include reinstatement."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:31;0;0;"He did pursue a case for unfair dismissal. Requiring someone to do work they object to on principle could be construed as constructive dismissal, so he may have had a case. However, it appears the case went to mediation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:28;0;0;"But the fact remains that if you refuse to do the work you are employed to do, and the employer cannot find other suitable work for you to do, your employment will be terminated, probably in the form of redundancy. That, I'm afraid, is the nature of employment contracts."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:26;0;0;"Refusing to do work he considered illegal is of course entirely right and just. My analysis is in no way intended to be a criticism. I very much admire people who will put their employment at risk on a point of principle."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:23;0;0;"Thus my conclusion is that although the fact that he objected to the work he was being expected to do was a cause (perhaps the primary cause) of the dispute with his employer, his job was terminated because he refused to do the work, not because he complained to the Law Society."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:21;0;0;"He also states in a subsequent blogpost that he was made redundant, not dismissed. This suggests that the primary cause of the termination of his employment was his refusal to do the work he was employed to do. If the employer could not redeploy him, redundancy was inevitable."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:19;0;0;"He refused to return to work on that basis, and wrote a letter to the Law Society alleging the employer was guilty of malpractice. It is clear from that letter that he hoped the Law Society's involvement would prevent the employer dismissing him."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:15;0;0;"I would hazard a guess that at that point the employer terminated his sick leave and told him he must return to work. Returning to work would mean doing the work he was employed to do, including work that he objected to."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:13;0;0;"So the picture appears to be one of a long-running dispute. However, it escalated after the employer paid for him to see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist reported that he was not very ill and could return to work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:11;0;0;"The tone of employer communications suggests a considerable degree of exasperation on their side. His employment was evidently already at risk at the time he went off sick."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:10;0;0;"He does not reveal the full nature of that dispute, though he gives the impression that the dispute was entirely about the HFC Bank contract. The extracts from employer communications he has published appear to suggest there may have been other matters too."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-22 09:07;0;0;"Reading through the material he has published on his blog reveals that he was in dispute with his employer over the terms of his employment 10 months before he reported them to the Law Society."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:57;0;0;"Unfortunately Mr. Ethical heard the Today interview but not the World Service one. Perhaps he would not have jumped to such wrong conclusions had he heard the World Service interview."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:56;0;0;"This interview was not briefed, because it was not live on air, though going out very soon after recording so not much time for editing. The presenter did not know what I was going to say and did not direct me at all."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:55;0;0;"In that interview, I linked the Gupta case with HSBC's criminal prosecution for money laundering in Mexico, and reminded everyone that it has only just come off probation and that another money laundering prosecution would therefore be extremely serious."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:53;0;0;"Shortly before the Today interview, I recorded a longer interview for the World Service in which I discussed HSBC's involvement in the Gupta money laundering case currently being investigated by the FBI and FCA. The BBC presenter specifically asked me to discuss it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:52;0;0;"When I explained that we had covered what we agreed in the briefing and had simply moved on to the next bank, he took offence at the idea that there was a briefing. After that it degenerated rapidly because he doesn't understand how live TV and radio works."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:49;0;0;"Rubbish. This was a very short interview which was covering 4 banks. The presenter changed the subject because there was no time left. Unfortunately Mr. Ethical read into the change of subject an intention that simply wasn't there."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:45;1;0;"Yes, and I corrected his point. I explained that I did not try to go off message and the presenter did not change the subject for any other reason than running out of time. I said that we covered exactly what we discussed in the briefing. He objected to there being a briefing.https://twitter.com/SRon79/status/965957131533996032 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:43;0;0;"Rubbish."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:31;0;0;"For the record, the BBC explicitly asked me to discuss it. And I did not tell them in advance what I would say. Unlike the Today interview, this interview was not discussed in advance of recording."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:29;0;0;"No, I don't. I think he needs to get over himself. Publicly accusing someone of corruption is a much, much bigger deal. Apart from anything else, it is libel."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:28;0;0;"It is entirely his fault. He said I was complicit in what he believes to be a sustained BBC cover-up about HSBC. And he said that when he called this out, I defended the BBC for personal gain. They only tweeted me because of what he said about me."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:20;0;0;"So you really don't think accusing me of corruption is any big deal. Dude, you really need to reconsider your values."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:18;0;0;"You know why."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:18;0;1;"I discussed all of this on the World Service THIS MORNING. It was pre-recorded and broadcast simultaneously with my live Today programme interview. I did not discuss it on the Today programme bcs I only had 2 minutes to discuss HSBC's results and forecasts for three other banks."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:15;0;1;"And if it is found guilty of facilitating money laundering in the Gupta case, it will richly deserve to lose its banking licence. Have I made myself clear?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:14;0;1;"The Gupta case is currently being investigated by the FBI in the US, and the FCA and the National Crime Agency in the UK. If HSBC was complicit - either knowingly or through failure to deploy proper KYC/AML procedures, as in Mexico - I expect it will have the book thrown at it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:12;0;0;"Let me say this. Today, on the World Service, I discussed HSBC's involvement in the Gupta money laundering and fraud case in South Africa. It is remarkably similar to HSBC's role in Mexican money laundering, for which it was fined and put on probation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:10;0;0;"Why don't you address the point I made? Defending a corrupt institution for personal gain meets the normal definition of corruption. Therefore, he accused me of corruption."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:09;0;1;"it was radio."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:08;0;0;"No I didn't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:07;0;1;"I don't know what's wrong with him. Clearly I couldn't cover any of that stuff in a thirty-second take on today's full-year results. And the presenter was not wrong to limit the time. We had three more banks to cover and the entire interview was only 2 minutes."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:05;0;0;"So accusing me of corruption wasn't a low blow, but accusing him of sour grapes was? Blimey you have some skewed values."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 22:02;0;0;"note HSBC's involvement in the Russian laundromat. I found it particularly painful to be accused of covering up HSBC's nefarious activities because I didn't discuss them in a 2-minute interview about 4 banks including HSBC this morning."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:54;0;0;"I have to be careful what I say, obviously, but imho this is a major scandal."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:51;1;2;"Regulators must surely be complicit. Latvian banks' involvement in suspected money laundering and fraud has been an open secret for years.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:31;0;0;"I don't ignore it. But I can't discuss it in 30 seconds. This morning I also did a longer piece for the World Service in which I discussed HSBC's involvement in the Gupta money lending case currently being investigated by the FBI and the FCA."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:26;0;0;"No. But I do block people who accuse me of bullying and use offensive language towards me. Goodbye, troll."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:25;0;0;"My bio is just fine. I corrected his facts. He didn't like me doing so."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:18;0;1;"Bad comparison. I do not "prop up the system". I do not work for banks, either paid or unpaid. My work for some years now has been to comment on and criticise banks. I have been severely critical of HSBC. These allegations are ridiculous."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:16;0;6;"Accusing me of defending an institution he believes to be corrupt purely to ensure future appearances is accusing me of corruption.https://twitter.com/fingeroffudge13/status/965932937748336641 …"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:02;0;0;"I "defended" the BBC on this occasion because his take on what happened is factually wrong. I was there and he wasn't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:01;0;0;"I understand the point of "you defend the BBC in order to ensure future appearances" perfectly, thank you. It's corruption. That's what he is accusing me of."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 21:00;1;3;"You have accused me of defending the BBC - an organisation you believe is corrupt - in order to ensure future appearances. That is corruption. Therefore, you have accused me of corruption. https://twitter.com/nw_nicholas/status/965933357577265152 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:58;0;0;"Bollocks. He accused me of defending an institution he believes is corrupt in order to ensure future appearances. That is defamatory. And he moaned about me to his followers without tagging me in. That is unethical."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:56;0;1;"Perhaps, but that does not mean that I am complicit in that as has been alleged. This was never intended to be anything but a very short take on the HSBC results today. It was THIRTY SECONDS ffs."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:55;0;0;"No it bloody isn't. It is perfectly simple. I'm being accused of corruption because I corrected someone's misunderstanding about what happened in a short BBC interview this morning."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:54;1;2;"You aren't behaving ethically right now. You are baselessly accusing me of corruption, and subtweeting criticism of me in order to wind up your followers."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:49;0;0;"It's bloody ridiculous."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:48;0;6;"Your complaint is that we didn't spend the entire 2 minutes discussing HSBC and its activities.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:47;0;3;"You have made repeated allegations that I was "towing the party line", that I said what they wanted me to say.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:41;0;2;"YES BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD TWO MINUTES TO DISCUSS FOUR BANKS. This is the FIFTH time I have pointed this out. My contribution to the programme was never intended to be solely about HSBC. It was always a look forward to all four bank results this week."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 20:39;0;0;"You've spent all morning making allegations of corruption against me, and you expect me to agree to a "truce" without any apology or retrenchment from you?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 05:17;0;0;"I think the BIS has probably moved on in its thinking since then. Countries don't "pay back" debt denominated in their own currency."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 05:16;0;0;"And I think you might be surprised. But as we don't have the stats, the point is moot. No justification whatsoever for pension at 60."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 05:14;0;0;"There were probably some who allowed their husbands to treat them like doormats, but I'd expect the vast majority had a more equal division of chores."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 04:31;7;42;"As a woman, I object to this. I don't want to be treated as a poor weak thing that can't work for as long as big strong men.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 04:28;0;0;"I don't follow any theory of money. I am a practitioner. I say loan accounting works as it does because I designed computer systems that do loan accounting."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 03:07;0;0;"No.....you just haven't understood this, sorry, and right now I can't explain it as I have to go out. Later."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 03:06;0;0;"anyway, g2g. Thanks for chat."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 03:06;0;1;"No, you don't have any choice. Markets and international trade are more powerful than you. Unless you want to start a global war, that is."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 03:05;0;0;"Economic textbooks are persistently wrong about this. It is not helpful to keep talking about money multipliers and reserve requirements, when bank lending does not rely on either."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 03:04;0;0;"No it doesn't. Sorry, you are simply wrong on this, and I do not think you have understood what Anwar Shaikh is saying. Banks do not obtain cash reserves in advance of lending, unless there is a reserve scarcity."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 03:02;0;0;"it is not in producer nations' interests to stop financing US deficits. Think it through. Nothing to do with central banks. It's about markets and trade."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:58;0;0;"What Anwar Shaikh says is correct. A new loan comprises a loan asset and a deposit liability, both created ex nihilo. A customer's deposit comprises a new deposit liability and an increase in cash reserve, which the bank may subsequently exchange for other assets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:56;0;0;"Yes, the loans are the assets. The matching deposits are liabilities. Creating them does not need there to be existing cash. Cash (reserves) for settlement can be obtained afterwards."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:55;0;1;"here you go - Rey & Gourinchas on "Exorbitant Privilege and Exorbitant Duty". I've discussed this with Rey. She is v clear that the US has no choice but to accept its duty as "insurer of last resort" for the world, because markets enforce it. http://www.helenerey.eu/RP.aspx?pid=Working-Papers_en-GB&aid=71510901685_67186463733 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:51;0;1;"Always."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:50;0;0;"Helene Rey calls it "exorbitant duty". I call it "exorbitant burden". You don't get to lay down a burden unless someone else wants to pick it up - which they don't. And you can't renege on a duty imposed on you by global markets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:49;0;0;"No."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:48;0;0;"the reserve ratio would of course be based on the bank's liabilities, because it is designed to ensure that the bank has sufficient cash (asset) to fund the simultaneous withdrawal of an agreed proportion of its deposits (liabilities)."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:46;0;0;"deposits are not assets. Ever. You are using the term incorrectly, from an accounting point of view. Reserves are assets, loans are assets, cash balances are assets. Deposits are liabilities."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:45;0;4;"That is a very US-centric view of the world. I could equally say that the US must overconsume in order to support the overproduction of producer nations - which as there are far more of them, is much closer to the truth."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:43;0;0;"I don't think so."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:42;0;0;"No it doesn't. Money creation through lending simply arises from double entry accounting and the way we measure "money". Creating a new asset-liability pair on lending increases M2. Pricing has nothing to do with it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:40;0;0;"If banks can't easily obtain reserves, reserve requirements can inhibit lending. But in these days of activist central banks and electronic reserves, that is unlikely."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:39;0;0;"I know that India has a reserve requirement. But reserve requirements are intended to protect payments, rather than inhibit lending. They ensure that banks have the cash to settle deposit withdrawals."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:37;0;0;"Deposits are not reserves. Wrong side of the balance sheet. Deposits are liabilities. Reserves are cash. Regarding the money multiplier, that is an ex post arithmetic calculation. If banks are confident of being able to obtain reserves, they ignore it when lending."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:35;0;0;"It was offensive and completely out of order. And so is this comment. I write about international trade and finance for a living. You are saying I don't know my job. I assure you I do. I am not describing a "world that no longer exists", I am describing today's world."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:33;0;0;""....the rotation of excess imbalances toward advanced economies—with deficits increasingly concentrated in the United States and United Kingdom—likely entails lower deficit-financing risks in the near term...." Completely the opposite of your argument."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:32;0;0;"And by "producer nations" I don't just mean EMs. I also mean Western countries that are certainly not "former UK colonies". Read the IMF's External Sector report:https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2017/07/27/2017-external-sector-report …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:25;0;1;"You need to think about what is in the economic interests of producer nations, rather than throwing low blows at me because I'm British. Buying US goods and services is not among those interests. Getting the US to buy their goods and services is. They are all export-led."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:23;0;0;"WTF are you talking about? If former UK colonies wanted to remain UK colonies. I would be recommending a gold standard, since the British Empire ran on gold. You've completely lost the plot."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:21;0;0;"The only global central bank that might want to pick up the reserve currency baton at some point is the ECB. But not now. It doesn't have the tools to manage the capital account, and the imbalances between member countries are far too wide."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:19;0;0;"in a gold standard, central banks do not have control of the money supply. Central banks like to have control of the money supply. Your "neutral reserve asset with floating exchange rates" also would mean they lost control of the money supply. Think about it. They won't do that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:18;0;0;"Not one of the global central banks wants to pick up the reserve currency baton. Nor does any central bank want to return to any sort of gold standard."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:17;0;0;"You can call it "corruption", "corporatism" and "clientelism" if you like. I would agree with all of those. Doesn't affect what I said. But there is no reason for the US's silly healthcare system to destroy the USD's international credibility. You are clutching at straws."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:15;0;1;"Yes, that's exactly what producer nations want. They want the US to buy their goods and services in return for USD. They don't want to buy the US's goods and services in return for their own currencies or gold. Any more than WalMart wants to buy your goods and services."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:13;0;0;"Also, this statement "Assets determine the amount of liabilities a bank can create" is factually wrong. Banks create both a new liability and a new asset when they lend. They do not need pre-existing assets in order to create new asset-liability pairs. They need equity."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:11;0;0;"in most regulatory regimes it is bank capital (equity), not reserves (assets), that determine the amount of lending a bank can do."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:09;0;0;"Yes they would. Banks don't need reserves in order to lend. They need them to settle deposit drawdowns. For example, Canada's banks operate on a zero-reserve basis. They make loan deposit entries ex nihilo, then borrow reserves as needed."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:06;0;1;"that's nonsense too. Other countries don't have the healthcare costs of the US, but they still have doctors. The US healthcare system is crazy because the US govt is captured by special interests - doctors' lobbies, Big Pharma, insurers. Doesn't have to be like that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:04;0;0;"oh and gross mismanagement of its oil reserves and its state-owned oil company, which is bankrupt."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:04;0;0;"*high five*"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:04;0;0;"Straw man *klaxon*. What is happening in Venezuela is fundamentally an FX crisis caused by terms-of-trade collapse, exacerbated by a corrupt and self-seeking dictatorship that has borrowed far too much in foreign currencies."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 02:02;0;1;"nonsense. Ultimately the USD is backed by global production of real goods & services. As long as global production of real goods and services keeps pace with USD creation (incl future production and future creation in the form of USTs), there is zero risk of hyperinflation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 01:59;0;0;"Could you please remember that oil trading is not everything? When I talk about global trade, I am not talking about oil."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 01:58;0;0;"No, they don't. Ultimately the liquidity and convertibility of the USD is more important than anything. They prefer USD. That's why majority of global trade - including trade between non-US countries - is in USD."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:54;0;1;"USD is used for the majority of global trade transactions. Thought to be over 80%. Driver is FX not repo."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:45;0;0;"In markets, yes. In shopping malls, not so much. Main Street matters as much as Wall Street, and Main Street uses USD for transactions, not USTs."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:44;0;0;"I've been the target of a tweet storm. I don't think she handled this well - she's become defensive, which is never a good look. But it is very hard to keep your emotional balance when you are receiving thousands of abusive tweets. It's also hard to recognise reasonable comment."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:41;0;1;"FWIW I think Mary Beard is wrong. She completely missed the systemic issues in the aid sector - known abusers deliberately given opportunities to abuse vulnerable (black) women and children, "white saviour" dynamics, belittling and silencing of whistleblowers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:38;0;1;"Dr. Gopal's critique is a wonderful exception, being both rigorous and compassionate, a rare combination. I've strongly recommended it to my followers. The rest of the stuff thrown at Mary Beard needs to be consigned to the dustbin of history."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:35;0;0;"I saw the stuff being thrown at her, and much of it was simply abusive. There wasn't much reasoned critique."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:32;0;1;"no they aren't"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:31;1;4;"You don't support the # WASPI campaign's ask. Labour policy falls a long way short of that. Stop misleading people.https://twitter.com/ErewashLabour/status/965594360367796224 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:29;1;1;"in 2006, 90% of 1950s women knew SPA was rising "in the future". Presumably, # WASPI women didn't realise that meant they would be affected, even though they were retiring "in the future". <headdesk> https://twitter.com/jpm287/status/965600937057415169 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:27;0;0;"no they weren't. Women's SPA was raised by 5 years in 1995, with a 10-year transition starting 2010. Rises to 66, 67 and 68 for both women and men were imposed by the Labour government in 2007, transition to start in 2024. 2011 Act accelerated both the 1995 and 2007 rises."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-20 00:22;0;3;"There was indeed valid criticism. There was also bullying. We need to distinguish clearly between the two. The first, we should promote. The second, we should reject."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 22:37;0;2;"in the meantime, have a think about the implications of old white men being deliberately put in positions where they can abuse destitute women, girls and boys. Would that have happened if the destitute were white?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 22:33;0;2;"no....you peg gold to oil, not the other way round"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 22:32;0;0;"Well, to my mind this has been brilliantly achieved. We are all discussing whether or not an elderly British academic is a racist, while ignoring the real issue, which is the growing evidence of widespread institutional racism and abuse in the aid sector."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 21:04;0;1;"tbh doesn't that suggest there is quite a bit of cognitive dissonance around this point? Ppl want far fewer immigrants. They can only achieve that by sending those already here back, but they don't want to admit that because as you say, it crosses a line."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 21:01;0;0;"No, it really isn't. I'm shocked by your cavalier assertion that it is ok for PoC to use ad hominems and even barefaced lies in debate. You would be the first to criticise me if I did that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:59;0;0;"fair enough, I too am critical of people who adapt evidence to justify their framing."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:58;0;0;"Why is it more important to discuss the beliefs of an elderly white British academic than the growing evidence that the entire aid sector is a playground for racists and child abusers?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:55;0;0;"Why is it more important to discuss the racist undertones in Mary Beard's tweet than the fact that old white men who were known abusers were deliberately put in positions where they could abuse black children with impunity - which is what we were discussing?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:53;0;0;"Now, explain this, please. Why is whether or not Mary Beard is a racist (or I am, for that matter) of SO much more importance to you than institutional racism in the aid sector, which is what my original tweet to which you responded was about?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:50;0;0;"I don't think data is useless, but we should be aware of its limitations, especially survey data on politically-sensitive matters."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:38;0;2;"I don't think what polls say and political parties support is really indicative of attitudes towards immigrants in the general population. The lived experience of immigrants is more relevant IMHO."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:33;0;1;"Good. So now you know how it feels to be misinterpreted and accused of saying things that you didn't,"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:32;0;0;"I gave an example, that is all. You read all sorts of things into it that weren't there, for reasons that you have not disclosed."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:31;0;0;"FFS. Get over yourself. Learn to debate the point instead of attacking the person. Then you might find people listen to what you say."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:29;0;1;"So it's ok for PoC to use ad hominem attacks as a debating strategy with white people, but not vice versa? Is that what you're saying?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:28;0;0;"Once again again you tell barefaced lies. I never called you a bully. And you did resort to ad hominem attacks. That is evident in the tweet stream, which others are of course free to read. I'm disappointed in you, frankly. I expected better."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:22;0;1;"So, no-one wants to send EU migrants back, then. Poles who complain that they have been victimised are making it all up. The EU migrants who are leaving because they don't feel welcome here any more are snowflakes. Is that what you're saying?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:19;0;0;"Nice try, but it's not what I said or implied. I am not responsible for they way you chose to interpret it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:18;0;0;"It is an illegitimate strategy. If she were an ordinary person I would accept that she might respond to pressure in that way. But she is an academic. She knows how to debate fairly. I hold her to higher standards."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:16;0;0;"I find it particularly depressing that a woman of colour, who no doubt frequently experiences such put-downs herself, feels it is ok to use such illegitimate debating tactics."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:13;0;1;"Yes, I'm afraid it is. Saying that someone is trying to make herself look like a victim is a pure ad hominem put-down designed to close debate. It's impossible to debate as an equal on that basis."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:10;0;0;"Ok."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:10;0;0;"So that is now four facts you have got wrong. Btw I accept your point that those who wanted to kick our West Indian immigrants were only a small proportion of those who wanted less WI immigration, though I don't see the relevance of 1960s statistics to the 1980s."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 20:08;0;1;"My statement was qualified. "People who voted for Brexit because they wanted less immigration from the EU" is not the sum total of all Leave voters, nor even the majority. Nor did I say or imply that all of those who wanted less immigration told Poles to go home."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:58;0;0;"Tell me, how did you vote in the referendum? After all if you are going to argue that my vote for Remain biases my comments, you must surely accept that the direction of your vote equally biases yours. Let's have full disclosure, please."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:56;0;2;""The people who voted for Brexit" is simply a neutral description. I did not campaign for Remain and am not politically active. So, now that's three facts you have got wrong."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:55;0;1;"So that is two facts you have got wrong, isn't it?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:53;0;0;"I'm not an academic. Have never claimed to be. Get your facts right."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:51;0;0;"Where did I say that "Poles go home" was a majority view"?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:49;0;1;"This has absolutely nothing to do with my support for Remain."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:43;0;1;"Yep. Hopefully Mary Beard will see things differently in a few days."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 19:41;11;23;"By "less immigration" they meant "kick out the ones already here". You know, like the people who voted Brexit because they wanted "less immigration from the EU", then when they won went around telling Poles they were all "going home".

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:55;0;0;"Oh so now you resort to ad hominem attacks. I said, right from the start, that you had every right to critique comments you find problematic. But once again you cherry-pick my comments to justify your framing. Selection bias, much?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:52;0;0;"I haven't bent anything you say. I've responded to your comments fairly and honestly. But you have cherry-picked my tweets. I wouldn't like to think you did so to present a picture of me that you know to be false, but you've now made several statements about me that are not true."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:49;0;0;"I have not labelled the issue you take with this problem as bullying. That is a barefaced lie. I criticised the behaviour of some other women of colour as bullying. And I asked you to write a reasoned critique of Mary's comments."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:45;0;0;"Have you read her blogpost on this? I don't think she does understand why people responded like that. I think a calm, reasoned critique might help."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:43;0;0;"I don't think personal attacks on people convince them they have made a mistake. I think it makes them defensive. From reading Mary's blog, I'd say that's the effect on her. In that respect, the bullying was entirely counterproductive."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:39;0;0;"Yes, Mary needs to reconsider her position. If you read the whole thread to which you responded, you will see that we discussed that. I'm concerned that you have homed in on one or two comments in the thread and ignored the rest. Not what I would expect from an academic."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:36;0;0;"I would certainly do my best to ensure that valid critiques from WoC are heard. Why don't you write one?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:35;0;0;"You are effectively saying I should have remained silent while women of colour bullied another woman into silence. Do you even believe in free speech?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:30;0;0;"Btw you have just made an allegation about me that is not true. You allege that I did not elevate the voices of those who were making reasonable points. I did, actually. You have cherry-picked my comments."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:27;0;0;"I'm not going to defend bullies, sorry. If you, as a woman of colour, make a reasoned critique of Mary's comments, I will do my best to promote it. I can't offer more than that and I hope you would not expect me to."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:25;0;0;"By all means criticise the comment and point out the attitude it appears to reveal. But the bullying I saw went far beyond that. You should know, as an academic, that attacking the person in order to silence them is wrong. I don't agree with Mary, but I defend her right to speak."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:19;0;0;"It was much more than "pointing out the racist undertones". I would not have criticised them for that. I criticised them for their harpy-like behaviour. I've been on the receiving end of a storm like that - actually from white racists, believe it or not. I know how it feels."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:16;0;7;"Bullying is not "your voice and dignity". It is vile behaviour. Speaks volumes that you feel "gaslighted" because I said some women of colour behaved badly. Presumably you think it's ok for women of colour to bully other women, but I beg to differ.https://twitter.com/drfuraha_asani/status/965527023035789312 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:10;0;3;"Excuse me, but this is a gross calumny. A crowd of women bullied another woman until she broke down in tears, and then bullied her some more because she cried. You self-identify with the bullies. You don't have the moral high ground here."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 18:05;0;1;"Your problem is?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 17:28;1;0;"How rude you are."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 17:07;0;2;"No-one's "playing a victim". I expressed an opinion. Are you saying I have no right to do that because I'm white?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 17:06;0;0;"Wrong. It is what I genuinely think. I am as entitled to my opinion as you are."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:24;0;2;"Game, set and match. And on that note, I'm off to bed. Goodnight all!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:20;0;1;"You aren't getting it. The rest of the world wants to overproduce. It doesn't want to consume our exports. Any more than WalMart wants to consume your exports. It wants your money, not your exports."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:16;0;0;"Luke seems to be thinking of gold as a oil hedge."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:15;0;2;"Exactly. Gold can anchor an international unit of account like bancor, but it doesn't work as an international unit of account itself. Hence your question (and mine) about what the unit of account would be in Luke's scheme."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:13;0;2;"But as it stands, no-one really wants to ditch the USD."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:12;0;0;"Yeah, the IMF have been trying that one forever. There isn't much interest. Gold itself is not a suitable international unit of account. Insufficiently liquid. That's why Keynes suggested bancor and the IMF is pushing the SDR."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:10;0;0;"They aren't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:10;0;1;"No"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:09;0;3;"Economics is not a morality play. At present, the world needs the US and the UK to be net consumers, because everyone else is a net producer. It isn't possible for all countries to have trade surpluses (ie be net producers). We don't trade with Mars (yet)."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:07;0;3;"Yes, that's right. Under Keynes' scheme, the IMF would have been a bank. Bancor would have been anchored to gold. Keynes envisaged fixed exchange rates to bancor and a symmetric intervention mechanism to force trade balance for surplus countries as much as deficit."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:03;0;1;"All central banks include gold in their diversified reserves. It's the universal FX reserve. Amount signifies absolutely nothing except the demand they anticipate for unspecified FX settlement. You are reading way too much into this imho."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:01;0;0;"I didn't say it was."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:01;0;3;"totally."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 10:00;0;0;"other candidates want export-led growth (Eurozone, Japan) or balanced trade (China, eventually), and UK is too small and fragile now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:59;0;2;"Yes, it's a huge problem. I call it the "exorbitant burden". It's the reason why no other country wants to pick up the premier reserve currency baton."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:58;0;0;"US is still bailing out the ROW now, helped by the UK (which still acts as second reserve - investors are creatures of habit). Hence the persistent trade deficits in both countries. IMF commented on this last fall. US and UK are "consumers of last resort" for ROW."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:56;0;3;"Hell yes. Have you read Helene Rey on the US's "exorbitant duty"? Exorbitant privilege = in good times, US gets to borrow lots at low interest rate with no risk of run on currency. Exorbitant duty = US must bail out the rest of the world when everything goes horribly wrong."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:54;0;0;"Yes, that's been tried. It causes depression. You know, like the 1930s. That's why we don't have a gold standard now."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:53;0;2;"And of course China are really going to tell your contacts in Russia and Venezuela what they are up to.... not"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:52;0;0;"Floats against what unit of account?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:51;0;0;"Yes. They seem think dollar recycling is is coming to an end. Afraid of the Euro, I guess. Alternatively, they don't understand dollar recycling and think the only way of controlling a market is to dominate supply."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:47;0;2;"Luke is basically saying that countries can print more and more of their own currencies as gold rises in price. True, but doesn't solve the international liquidity problem. Doesn't make for stable currencies either."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:45;0;0;"think you have really misunderstood this, sorry."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:44;0;0;"Nope, it wants to control the oil price not the USD trade value."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:44;0;0;"And liquidity, if it is to be used for settlement. Price rises make it less liquid, not more."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:43;0;0;"yeah, derivatives exposure not a big deal at Mitie. It's a mess for other reasons. Capita a different matter. Would like to see Connaught."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:42;0;0;"An individual country can run out of gold and can be priced out of the market. Don't you understand competitive markets?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:41;0;1;"No it doesn't. It ends with primary reserve currency issuer abandoning gold. Bankruptcy is meaningless for a country that issues its own currency and its own debt. Gold cannot supply liquidity - rising price makes it less liquid, not more (see Bitcoin)."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:39;2;10;"YES. China is trying to control the USD oil price, not replace the USD with the CNY. US knows this btw - energy dominance ambition is also about controlling oil price. Trade war."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:36;0;3;"Fallacy of composition. Under a gold standard settlement system, an individual country can run out of gold if it persistently runs trade deficits. It can also be priced out of the market for gold. Think about it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:35;0;0;"yes they do. Premier reserve currency issuer provides liquidity to the world, not just to its own back yard. Requires persistent deficits to maintain global liquidity, but this makes relying on external reserve asset unworkable. This is the # TriffinDilemma."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:32;0;1;"umm, China's strategy is to rebalance away from export-led growth. I think you are far too optimistic about relying on a finite reserve asset. History shows that this does not end well. Imho this is not what China is planning to do. You have misunderstood purpose of its gold."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:29;0;2;"Doesn't sound like the action of a country that wants to ditch the USD."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:28;0;1;"No government has infinite quantities of a reserve asset that it doesn't issue. Therefore the Triffin dilemma is always an issue. Think on it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:27;0;1;"Euroland being what it is, it probably hasn't dawned on the member states yet that the Euro must be backed by enormous quantities of risk-free government debt or it will be far too illiquid to act as premier reserve & settlement currency."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:25;0;2;"True. But it isn't ready for Euro to replace USD for international settlement. It doesn't have the capital account instruments. Needs much bigger issuance of Euro denominated safe assets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:22;0;1;"er no, Triffin dilemma is always an issue."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:18;0;0;"Carillion yes. And Capita. Had a look at Mitie, too. Haven't looked at the others. Sadly no CD as yet....."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:17;0;1;"yes, please do! Thanks. Goodnight!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:17;0;1;"thanks"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:16;0;2;"No-one wants a strong dollar. It is not in anyone's interests. Dominance of US in global trade means global trade contracts when USD rises. 0,6-0.8% hit to global trade volumes for 1% rise in broad dollar index."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:14;0;1;"Vowel modification is necessary to maintain vocal position for higher notes. Foundation of bel canto, really."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:13;1;4;"I can't see how it is in anyone's interests to destabilise USD as Luke envisages. Least of all China. No-one wants to pick up the premier reserve currency baton."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:09;0;1;"kent is a mess imho"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:09;0;1;"Oh blimey. I haven't looked at that. Eeek."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:08;0;2;"hehe, I was actually replying to Luke.....I knew your comment was sarcastic!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:07;0;1;"yes of course. And humiliation. I think that matters a lot."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:06;0;1;"Yes, I do."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:05;0;4;"maybe I am not getting this, but if CNY is not convertible, why would anyone accept it in payment for oil and food? CNY must be convertible or there will be no market, and that has serious implications for China's economic policy # Triffindilemma"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:02;0;1;"I can believe that. One institution looks much like another. My local workhouse (seriously, it is 5 min walk away) is now a health centre."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 09:00;0;0;"that said, however, Nazi racism was all about "superiority"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:59;0;1;"what I learned from that was that racism doesn't necessarily stem from any sense of "superiority". May arise from competition between equally oppressed groups and fear of losing the little they have."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:55;0;0;"yes exactly. Here's another thought. The Irish who emigrated to America during and after the famine became the lowest class of "free" workers. When the slaves were freed, the Irish became very racist because the former slaves competed with them for subsistence jobs."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:51;0;1;"Workhouses were originally intended for able-bodied adults and children only but in 1870 they decided to put the elderly and infirm in workhouses too, where of course they were made to work because that's what workhouses were for....."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:50;0;1;"It wasn't a good time. Workhouses introduced in 1834 to replace unemployment benefit and income support because shockingly low wages made those benefits too expensive. Workhouses are another form of slavery, aren't they?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:45;0;0;"I'm not seeing the argument, sorry. Why do you think the world will swing away from USD as international reserve & settlement currency? There is no obvious replacement."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:42;0;0;"Lol, elevated political risk...."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:41;0;1;"wonderful."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:40;0;1;"this is why I don't like all this "white people are oppressors, black people are oppressed" stuff. The reality is much more complex."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:38;0;0;"And here's another thought. The mills employed sweated labour at starvation wages, including children as young as 6. There were riots in 1842 because the mill owners cut wages to less than the price of bread and people were starving in work. At least slaves get fed, usually......"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:37;0;1;"here's a thought. Long after Britain abolished slavery, the cotton mills were importing cotton from slave plantations in America. Britain virtuously claimed not to have slaves, while benefiting from the production of slaves. Nice, eh?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:33;0;1;"hmm, we blow hot & cold imho"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:32;0;0;"they probably did. UK is not exactly guiltless either, though. The Clearances after Culloden were ethnic cleansing of the Highland Scots, a war crime and good case to be regarded as genocide. Irish famine of 1846-51 is claimed by many to be genocide - 1.5m ppl died."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:27;0;0;"and I could put forward a good case for sweated labour in factories and mines during the Industrial Revolution being akin to slavery. The report that led to the 1833 Collieries Act makes chilling reading. Terrible abuse, particularly of child workers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:25;0;1;"That's a short period of time compared to the history of Europe. Also, it depends what you mean by slavery. The feudal system of mediaeval times could be regarded as a form of white slavery (bonded serfdom). Lasted for around 300 years - broke down after the Black Death 1348-50."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:20;0;1;"hehe French exceptionalism is a very long-running story!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:18;0;0;"racism in Europe takes different forms, including white-on-white racism - which has resulted in some of the worst atrocities in history. Crimean Tatars, for example. Albanian genocides. Worst of all, genocide of ethnic Slavs & Poles under the Nazis - approx 7.5 million people."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:10;0;0;"this is what I have been trying to explain all day. American model of white-black power relationships is far too polarised for anywhere in Europe."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:04;0;0;"Ooh that's interesting. I've heard about that but not read it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:04;0;0;"Cheddar Man is brilliant. Black man with blue eyes who lived in Britain 10,000 years ago and has living descendents - who are white with brown eyes. Can't see how any racist lobby can cope with that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 08:02;0;1;"Yes, she did. From the white "I'm not a racist, but...." lobby. How very dare she suggest that Roman Britain was multiracial and some black people were rich and powerful."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:58;0;1;"oddly enough we need Mary Beard to answer this question - it's her field!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:57;0;1;"I'm not sure that's true, Rajan. Typically, people were enslaved when they lost a war. At the height of the Roman Empire there would have been a lot of black slaves because of the conquest of African countries. But the rest of the time Europeans mainly fought each other."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:52;0;1;"No doubt. But the Oxfam scandal (and the rest) isn't going away any time soon."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:51;0;0;"It's going down, isn't it?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:49;0;0;"I wouldn't personally have tweeted the pic and the comment about crying. I think it makes things worse. But the "white tears" stuff they threw at her was pure vitriol. Horrible."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:42;0;0;"True. TBH this was all a bit hamfisted, really."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:40;1;0;"Reading this, the MTM loss on derivatives leaps out at me. Noble's creditworthiness is deteriorating rapidly. Wonder how realistic this restructuring scheme is.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:24;0;1;"I felt that the women who played the race card were really unfair, though. They claimed she was a white colonialist defending the racist oppression of black people. That's what really upset her, I think."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:23;0;2;"I saw it. A lot of people missed the point, thought she was defending or endorsing child abusers, and went for the jugular. Really nasty comments. I've had a few myself because I defended her."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:16;0;2;"thank you for sharing that. Orphanages and children's homes have often been targeted by abusers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:15;0;2;"Yes, I agree with you. From what I've heard already, there are more scandals to come."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:11;0;0;"I agree it looks more like a parodied quote. But tbh if you are at the centre of a tweetstorm, parody is hard to see. Everything looks like a personal attack."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 07:02;0;0;"the press has a point too. The abuse she received was vile."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:59;0;0;""
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:53;0;4;"Yep. This is a systemic issue in the entire sector. That's what Mary Beard missed. She's right that people can opportunistically do bad things under stress when social norms have broken down, but that isn't what's going on here."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:51;0;0;"Please see the rest of my comments. No-one is legitimising abuse."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:48;0;0;"Possibly, she knows from her work that atrocities do happen in disaster zones where the rule of law has temporarily broken down, but has not looked beyond that to the systemic issues in this case? Academics can be blinkered sometimes."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:43;0;1;"I suggest you have a good look at the timeline of the person I was replying to. I don't call people "racists" lightly. It's a serious accusation, and in this case entirely justified in my view."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:27;0;1;"Yes please do. I suspect the answer will be that they are doing different jobs. That will then raise questions about equivalence."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:24;0;1;"that said, I think she has failed to notice the systemic element to this, so her comment is very wide of the mark. These were known abusers who were deliberately given the opportunity to abuse. We have to ask why."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:22;0;1;"I think it is reasonable to observe that everyone has a dark side, which can come out when the usual social norms break down. That is not in any way excusing or sanitising such behaviour."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:15;0;0;"if so, this is much darker and far more corrupt than what Mary suggested, which was in effect that aid workers might do bad things under stress. They might, but this looks systemic to me."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 06:13;0;0;"I also suspect that Oxfam were playing a "greater good" hand. Indeed that's pretty much what their CEO said. Tolerating child prostitution was the price of keeping on board people Oxfam regarded as essential for the delivery of the aid program."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 05:55;0;4;"I don't know. I wouldn't have said that, personally. Imho ppl are right to point out that the underlying dynamic here is racist. We have to ask ourselves whether, if the aid workers had been in (say) Italy, there would have been the same level of abuse. I doubt it."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 05:36;0;4;"The point she is making is that when rule of law breaks down, normally law-abiding people commit atrocities or applaud others who do.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 05:23;0;0;"Plus the Irish weavers forced into subsistence farming when their home-grown linen industry collapsed due to competition from cheap British cotton produced by American slaves and British sweated labour? Ireland was part of the U.K. at the time."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 05:14;0;0;"You can perhaps argue that British imperialism was so strongly racist that it defines white British womanhood. There's some mileage in that, though IMHO it's simplistic and the Scots, Welsh and Irish will violently disagree with you."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 05:07;0;0;"Here in the UK, it's extremely hard to argue that a white population that goes back over a thousand years is "defined" in relation to black people who arrived much more recently."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 04:34;0;0;"We do not have to accept your US-centric definition. There s a big world out there, and it's not much like your country. Stop being so bloody arrogant and learn about other countries and cultures."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 04:32;0;0;"You are an American who is trying to force other people to accept your imperialistic world view. But other countries are not like yours. America is deeply divided and horribly racist because of its history of black slavery. In other countries, racism takes different forms."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 04:28;0;1;"Europe's history is very different from the US. It's much longer and far more complex. Slavery, for example, existed for thousands of years here and was defined by conquest, not colour. Slaves were as likely to be white as black."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 04:14;0;0;"But it wasn't, in Europe. You really can't define "white womanhood" solely on the basis of American history. That's imperialist."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 03:04;0;0;"My apologies, I should have said "woman of colour". Read her timeline."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 03:02;0;0;"You might have done. I haven't, and I think the worse of you for doing so. Seems it is you who needs to learn, not me."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 03:01;0;0;"Indeed. So it also can't possibly be right for a woman of colour to write and teach about "white womanhood" - as is proposed in the link."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:59;0;0;"I'm not scared, just pointing out that it's impossible, just as white people credibly teaching *about* black people is impossible. Doesn't stop them doing it, but I don't think they should."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:58;0;2;"I know. And I fundamentally object to that. White people can't credibly teach about black people and shouldn't attempt to do so. That was the point of my tweet! But you can't fight one injustice by creating another. Equally wrong for black to teach *about* white imho."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:54;0;4;"Jeepers, that would piss off the WASPIs!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:53;0;0;"I have read some. I do not recognise what is said about white women. It is completely foreign to my own experience as a white British woman. But you don't care about that, do you?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:51;0;0;"The voices you think need to be heard - do they include those of white women, or are you only interested in hearing what people of colour believe about white women? If the latter, then this can only be an exercise in bigotry."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:49;0;0;"I'm not going to tolerate being patronised by you. I expect you to debate the points I make fairly. Resorting to ad hominems shows you have nothing to say."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:47;0;0;"It cannot credibly be done unless the voices of white women are fairly represented. Otherwise it is merely an exercise in bigotry and prejudice."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:45;0;0;"Now, I abhor racists, so as you are clearly a racist I am blocking you."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:44;0;0;"As you don't seem to know much history, you can't credibly assert you are on the "right side" of it. As for bigotry, it's not me who has the insufferable arrogance to claim they "can't be racist", and it's not me who is making prejudiced assertions about "class"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:40;0;1;"Yes!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:38;0;0;"So are you."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:37;0;1;"Yes, I've read the tweet. You do not have a monopoly on its interpretation. I have also read the blogpost in which she explained what she meant. I assume you haven't bothered to do this, because you already think you know."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:36;0;1;"There is a difference between trying to understand why people do terrible things and making excuses for them. You seem unable to comprehend this."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:35;0;2;"No, I'm not saying that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:33;0;0;"I have not been intellectually dishonest. Take your baseless allegations somewhere else."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:32;0;0;"Yes you can be racist. And some of you are."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:31;0;0;"I reject your racist allegations about white women. And since you are evidently a racist, and I abhor racists, I am now blocking you."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:30;0;0;"My statement explicitly acknowledges that people of colour experience this daily. Reading comprehension isn't one of your skills, clearly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:27;0;0;"If you think you can't be racist, you are racist."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 02:26;1;3;"I've noticed that a lot of the abuse thrown at Mary Beard has been from women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 01:19;1;0;"No black woman has the right to write and teach a course about "white womanhood". Any more than a white woman has a right to write and teach a course about "black womanhood". She knows nothing of it. If you can't this, you are racist."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 01:08;0;52;"No she wasn't. Get a grip."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 01:06;0;0;"And as you have now called me a racist, I'm going to block you. I don't tolerate that."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 01:05;0;0;"You don't have the right to define words the way you like and order me to accept your definition."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 01:02;0;0;"No."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-19 01:02;0;0;"You can change the words if you want. Doesn't change the reality."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 22:20;0;0;"Thanks. The reminder is welcome. Please don't describe the experience of Europeans as "self-righteousness" though. It's as valid as yours. Millions of people died because of European white-on-white racism. We must never forget."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 22:15;0;0;"Indeed, and that means leaning from our OWN history, not someone else's. White on white racism is a defining feature of recent European history. White on black is too, of course - not denying that. But it's not right to deny the experience of white victims of European racism."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 22:08;4;27;"They are women. There is overwhelming evidence that women are disproportionately the target of Twitter abuse, and that the level of violence (including sexual violence) in the abuse is much higher than it is for men."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 22:04;0;0;"You don't know anything about me, yet you ascribe motives to me and make judgements about me based on what you think I believe. That's called "prejudice". And because your prejudice is entirely based on the colour of my skin, it is racist. I block racists. Goodbye."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:58;0;0;"I woul also add that the framing of everything in American terms is a form of imperialism. European experience is different. That should be respected."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:50;0;0;"I make no apology for reminding those who would restrict the term "racism" to white-black power relations that the Nazis aimed to enslave the white Slav peoples because they considered them "inferior". Racism takes many forms."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:48;0;0;"It is when blatant racism is denied or ignored because the victims don't fit a racial stereotype."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:46;0;2;"Now I am going to block you, because your comments are racist and I don't like racists."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:45;1;1;"And as a European, I reject your claim to exclusive use of the team "racism"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:44;0;0;"Yep, I did. It's an unpleasant insect. I could have called her a louse. Would you have liked that better?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:43;0;2;"Thanks!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:42;0;1;"Apparently so. "White tears" are a form of oppression, apparently."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:40;0;0;"The Nazis planned to enslave the Slav peoples - Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Russians. They saw them as inferior to the "German race". They killed millions of them. But Slav peoples are white. So are Germans. White on white racism. Within living memory. LEARN ABOUT IT."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:34;0;0;"I too have been taught not to stereotype, though it's far too easy to do so without realising. But this piece is blatant. That's why I say it's racist."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:31;1;2;"You don't know anything about Europe, do you? You judge everything by your American experience. What about European minorities who experience racism daily, such as the Roma? Do you chuck them in a bucket called "white", too?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:27;0;0;"Insulting me proves nothing. I have not insulted you. But you are grossly ignorant."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:26;0;1;"No, it is YOUR ignorance that is astonishing. Do you even know about anti-Slav racism, anti-Irish racism? If you haven't then go and learn about them."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:23;0;4;"I know racism when I see it. I am a European. How dare you deny the European experience of extreme white-on-white racism leading to acts of genocide within living memory? And I do not mean anti-Semitism. Put your prejudice aside and learn."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:18;0;0;"State pension is not a defined benefit scheme. There are no funds under management, and neither the amount nor the age of receipt are guaranteed. It is a contributory benefit funded from hypothecated taxes on a pay-as-you-go basis."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:15;0;1;"You've entirely missed the point. I have no intention of doing any such thing. As you say, I am entirely unqualified. As is the woman who wrote the piece I linked. She knows no more about "white womanhood" than I do about "black womanhood"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:12;0;0;"Really? News to me. But I suppose if I had called her a "louse" or a "worm" you would have found some race angle to that, too."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:09;0;1;"You can't see the racism? Read it again substituting "black" for "white". Then you will see it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 21:07;0;0;""
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 13:39;0;0;"Riiight."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 13:08;0;3;"So although I abhor the racism that is so evident in this piece, it has nonetheless been a gift. To share the experience of others, even for a few minutes, is a rare privilege."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 13:05;2;12;"I was surprised how angry I was. I felt that I was in a "no-win" situation, where anything I did or said, however innocuous, would be negatively interpreted as evidence of my racism and privilege. That's the nature of prejudice, isn't it?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 12:54;2;10;"Reading this deeply racist piece gives me an unpleasant glimpse into what it is like to be "othered" - defined, degraded, dehumanised, denied a voice. Respect to the people of colour who experience this, and much worse, every day of their lives.https://twitter.com/anaisdpedica/status/965014317186904064 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 12:13;0;0;"FFS. Get over yourself. The tweet was not addressed to you."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 12:11;0;0;"Saying "white people think they have more privilege because of their skin colour" is racist. I am white. I know I have more privilege, and not just because of my skin colour. I can't help the country, the class, the family I was born into. But I can refuse to be defined by them."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 12:09;0;0;"That tweet was not addressed to you. It was addressed to the white racist who retweeted one of my tweets to someone else, and whom I have now blocked. However, I'm quite happy to block you too, if you would like me to."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:54;0;27;"White racists, let me make something completely clear. Just because I call out racist remarks by some women of colour does not mean I support your agenda. I regard ALL racism as despicable and I will block you on sight. Got it?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:47;0;1;"Mine too. I've been there. It is a horrible experience. Fortunately lots of my followers were really supportive, but I still ended up locking my account for a week until the trolls gave up. Some people have been hounded off Twitter though."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:46;0;0;"yep, I saw it and I called it out. You are racist and ageist."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:43;2;6;""Woman of colour" makes a racist remark about a white woman, gets called out for it, whimpers "snotfair to attack woman of colour" then resorts to ageist insults.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:41;1;4;"You don't get away with racist remarks just because you are a woman of colour. And you don't get away with ageist remarks either. I call out racism, sexism and ageism whenever I see it. You have shown your true colours. Racist and ageist. That's what you are."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:37;0;1;"Goodnight"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:37;0;0;"No, darling, I don't attack women of colour. I attack racists. That's what you are."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:36;5;7;"Tell me, Twitter, would it be ok for a white woman to write an "anthropology of black womanhood", or to want to create a "course on black womanhood" and say she hopes to teach it one day"?https://anaisduongpedica.wordpress.com/2017/12/30/anthropology-of-white-womanhood-a-bibliography/ …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:31;0;1;"Ah right, fair enough. Thanks."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:29;0;0;"yeah, I saw your tweet the first time. Yawn. When you've learned how to be a human being, we can talk. Until then, crawl back under your rock."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:27;0;1;"fine to moan about this I assure you. The system is being systematically altered to make it difficult for people to obtain the support they need. Those who know their way round it do well. Everyone else suffers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:25;0;2;"I'm not sure what your point is. I haven't assumed anything. I have called out a racist tweet, that is all."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:24;2;12;"Dear @ wmarybeard, you may not see this but...I know all too well what it's like to be at the centre of a storm of abuse after an ill-judged tweet. Best thing you can do now is be silent for a while. Don't engage, and above all don't show weakness. It only feeds the trolls."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:17;0;0;"ah, you got it! my comment was obviously too subtle for most people....."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:15;9;35;"And you are a racist. "White women" are not a homogenous group, any more than black women are. They are people like you. Show some compassion, please.https://twitter.com/anaisdpedica/status/965007179488157696 …"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:12;0;0;"I saw her tweet, and read her post. I am struggling to see how she "excused" those men. And you do not know whether she wept for those girls. There is an immense amount of self-righteous anger in your tweet. I am wondering what its real source is."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:08;0;2;"Sheesh, what a nasty piece of work you are. Show some compassion, for goodness sake."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:05;0;1;"As the state pension is not a property right prior to receipt - there is no savings "pot" - comparison with bank accounts is invidious."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:03;0;0;"I'm disappointed that no-one noticed my historical allusion!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:03;0;0;"Hah, always!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:02;0;0;"btw I think it is important to understand that legislation is its own notice."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:02;0;0;"Government did in fact give 15 years' notice of state pension age equalisation, 13 years' notice of the 2007 rise to 66, and a minimum of 4 years' notice of the 2011 acceleration of the 1995 and 2007 changes."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 11:00;0;0;"As I'm sure you are aware, eligibility criteria for all state benefits are set by Parliament and are subject to change without notice. That is true of the state pension as much as any other benefit. There is no statutory notice requirement."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:59;0;1;"NI contributions are not savings. They are best regarded as hypothecated taxes that pay for certain benefits including the state pension and also make a contribution to the NHS."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:58;0;1;"I think understanding that the state pension is a contributory benefit is crucial. Too often I hear people comparing it to a funded scheme, or saying they have "paid in" to it. It is nothing like a funded pension scheme. There are no funds under management and never have been."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:55;0;0;"Government does not individually notify people who could in future be JSA or ESA claimants when eligibility conditions for those change. Equally, it doesn't individually notify people who could be state pension claimants in future when SP eligibility terms change."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:52;0;1;"Yes, it could. I don't think anyone disagrees about that. The scattergun approach was ineffective."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:52;0;1;"The state pension is nothing like a bank account or a bank loan. It is a contributory benefit like JSA and ESA. Like them, eligibility is set by Act of Parliament.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:18;0;0;"With respect, I have gone over these arguments many, many times, with many, many people, over the last two and a half years, and I do not wish to go over them again with you."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:16;1;2;"The increase in pension age is not a vague concept. Government did provide information and many women did know about the state pension age rise."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:14;0;1;"As government had no duty to notify individually, it is hard to make a case for compensation. It is not maladministration for the DWP to fail to do something it has no legal duty to do."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:13;0;0;"Again, what are you trying to prove? I have read this myself, many times."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 10:12;0;0;"Yes. I've said that myself, many times. What are you trying to prove, except that you are new to this campaign whereas I have been writing about it for over 2 years?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:57;0;1;"I'm sure Trump will provide them with some money.....oh wait, don't his cheques always bounce?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:56;0;0;"I would also suggest that you read the Commons Briefing paper on women's state pension rises. It gives a comprehensive description of the ways the changes were communicated. http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7405 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:50;0;0;"Tragic."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:50;0;0;"I've already told you that Government does not inform personally of legislative changes. Regarding life expectancy outlook: I would suggest you read Michael Marmot's excellent piece on this http://marmot-review.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/the-rise-of-life-expectancy-in-uk-is.html …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:46;0;0;"I only know what is in the document."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:42;0;0;"You might find this helpful too. http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7405 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:41;0;0;"Indeed, so there are also no accurate figures to support assertions that a high proportion didn't know."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:40;0;1;"DWP research in 2004 found that 73% of 1950s born women knew the state pension age was rising, although a rather smaller proportion knew their exact state pension age: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130103111112/http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rports2003-2004/rrep221.pdf …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:34;0;0;"In this case, the initial announcement was made in the Budget speech of November 1993. You can read the speech here: http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page4283.html"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:33;0;0;"Government does not inform people individually about legislative changes. It does make information available, and it did so in this case. But people are supposed to inform themselves. Ignorance of the law is no defence."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:27;0;0;"Good. Glad I've been able to help her."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:26;0;0;"I have no doubt that a small proportion of the 3.8m 1950s women genuinely didn't know about the 1995 Act. But that is not a reason to give 3.8m women pensions at 60. It is at best a reason to give some means-tested relief to those in genuine hardship."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:24;0;0;"Of course they are. The point, though, is that if only 100,000 people INCLUDING friends and relatives of campaigners signed the petition, it is hardly representative of 3.8 million women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:22;0;0;"Perhaps you'd like to tell her that her SPA is two years earlier than she thinks it is? Would be very welcome news, I'm sure."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:21;0;0;"As I said, if the letter says 68 it is wrong. If it is a DWP letter then she has a case for maladministration. Her SPA is most definitely 66."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:20;0;1;"100,000 signatures is really not very many, considering the size of the cohort. And the signatures include relatives and friends of campaigners. It is not a reliable measure."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:19;0;1;"There are a few areas in the UK where life expectancy among the very old appears to be falling. But again, this does not affect your generation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:18;0;0;"Reports that life expectancy is falling were made by journalists who do not understand rates of change. http://www.coppolacomment.com/2017/08/a-maths-lesson-for-journalists.html …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:17;0;0;"Yes it is. Rate of increase has slowed significantly, but it is still rising. Also, slowdown in rate of increase affects younger generations more than yours. http://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources-reports/marmot-indicators-2017-institute-of-health-equity-briefing/marmot-indicators-briefing-2017-updated.pdf …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:16;0;0;"It is not helpful to insist that the 1995 Act was "not reported" when there is overwhelming evidence that it was widely reported from its announcement in 1993 onwards."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:15;0;0;"The plans were actually put in place long before 1995. There was a Green Paper that had over 4,000 responses, then a White Paper. Decision to equalise at 65 was announced in the Nov 1993 Budget and the timetable was explained then. Budget Speech is here: http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page4283.html"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:12;0;0;"Also, I believe the Teachers' Pension Scheme includes the state pension age in its forecasts. So you were informed. You just weren't paying attention."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:11;0;0;"It was reported. Jo Cumbo of the FT found over 600 reports over a variety of newspapers including tabloids. It was also announced in the Budget speech in November 1993, which was on prime time TV and radio news and the front pages of newspapers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:09;0;0;"That's not correct. If she is 61 now, her state pension age is her 66th birthday. If the letter says 68 it is wrong. You can check her correct state pension age here: https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:07;0;0;"Erm, it was a Labour government that legislated to raise state pension age to 66, 67 then 68."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:05;1;0;"Life expectancy has not gone down in the UK. It is rising. And the fact remains that you will get your state pension earlier than a man of your age and significantly earlier than younger women and men. That's what you should be thankful for."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:04;0;0;"So did many men of your age."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 09:00;0;0;"The present government wants to accelerate the rise to 68. But as I said, that is only a proposal at present. So the 2007 Act timetable applies."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:59;0;0;"Your pension age was hiked to 68 in 2007 by the Labour Government. Here's the timetable from the 2007 Pensions Act: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/22/schedule/3 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:51;0;0;"The only change to pension that he was instrumental in pushing through was the acceleration of the rise to 68. I remind you that this is still only a proposal. It has yet to pass the House."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:50;0;0;"And he did not "oversee the changes to pensions". The equalisation of women's pensions was legislated in 1995, and the additional 1-year rise in 2007. Both were accelerated in 2011. He joined the DWP in 2011, but the legislation to accelerate the changes was already in progress."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:48;0;0;"We are discussing the state pension. He will not get that until he is 66, the same age as all men and women of his age. He has retired early on his occupational pension in accordance with the terms of the scheme, like thousands of other public sector workers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:47;0;0;"You will get your state pension earlier than a man of your age, who has worked just as long and hard as you and will probably not live as long as you. And you will get your state pension considerably earlier than younger women and men will. You should be thankful."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:43;0;0;"Yes, I think it does."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:41;0;0;"You haven't been robbed of anything. You will get your state pension at the latest by March next year. Please stop moaning."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:38;0;0;"I think deviation of private/occupational and state pension ages has confused many # WASPI women. Teachers and nurses, for example, seem to have assumed their occupational and state pension ages were the same."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:36;0;0;"Yes, private pension age and state pension age can deviate. My private pension providers all assume I will take my pensions at 60, though my state pension age is now 66."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:31;0;0;"That's worrying."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 08:27;0;0;"interesting. DWP survey from 2004 showed that older women were more likely to know about state pension age rises."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:36;0;0;"Not a fan. Preserved the dominance of the West to the detriment of developing nations. And, partly because of that, was ultimately unsustainable."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:32;0;0;"Globalisation benefits a lot of people. I wouldn't want to turn the clock back. But I think we need to impede capital flows enough to tax them!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:27;0;0;"I don't think that is possible in a globalised world where there is free movement of capital. There will always be some part of the world where labour is abundant and cheap."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:26;0;1;"There is a gradual transition over 10 calendar years (2010-2020) and just under 4.5 birth years (April 1950 to October 1954). Those who are complaining about a sudden rise of 6 years were born after the end of the transition, i.e. from November 1954 onwards."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:23;0;1;"I think # UBI and job guarantees are complementary. Need # UBI so people can refuse work (necessary for dignity and to discipline employers). Need job guarantee so people can always have work if they want it. JG without # UBI is inevitably workfare at the margin."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:21;1;6;"What on earth is the point of this?https://twitter.com/imajsaclaimant/status/964964482198966279 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:17;0;0;"Well, I am in favour of Universal Basic Income. So I would abolish the state pension and give everyone a tax-free allowance which they can top up with earned and/or unearned income. Need other benefits too for people who can't work and don't have savings, of course."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:14;0;1;"Post-fact society."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:13;0;0;"Indeed. Their entire argument evaporates once the facts are explained."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:10;0;1;"I've spent hours and hours patiently explaining how the state pension system works, what the changes mean for them and where to look for information. They don't listen."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:08;0;3;"They still don't inform themselves now. They rely on hearsay, rather than finding out. So now some of them say their state pension age is 67, because they've heard that somewhere. But the maximum state pension age for these women is 66th birthday."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:03;0;0;"And I would add that as the whole point of raising the state pension age is that women should work for longer, compensating them for not saving enough to enable them to retire at 60 negates the purpose of the legislation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:02;0;0;"So as far as I am concerned, if they didn't know they weren't paying attention. Most of us did know. I am personally affected by this btw - my state pension has risen from 60 to 66."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 07:00;0;0;"Equalisation was announced in the 1993 Budget, which was broadcast on TV and radio, hit prime time news slots and was on the front pages of all newspapers. The legislation equalising SPA was passed in 1995 and again was reported in multiple news outlets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 06:58;0;2;"the ones who complain that they had "no notice" weren't paying attention in 1993 when rises of up to 5 years were announced, nor in 1995 when the rises became law, nor in 2007 when a further 1-year rise was legislated, nor in 2011 when both rises were accelerated....."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 06:55;1;0;"They haven't been deprived of anything. They will get their SP when they reach state pension age. Like everyone else.https://twitter.com/Hawkins2Mac/status/964936662215217152 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 06:51;0;0;"The campaign explicitly says that it is in favour of SPA equalisation. Setting the age limit at 31/12/59 enables them to make this claim credibly, since they are only demanding unequal pensions for one cohort of women, not all the women affected by SPA equalisation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 06:48;0;3;"They created a brand called "1950s women" and excluded everyone else. Many people have pointed out that this created a 6-year cliff edge for women born 1/1/60. But they don't care. They just say "start your own campaign"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 06:47;1;1;"It is equality, I'm afraid. The state pension age for both women AND men is rising to 66 for your age group. If you were the older and he the younger, you would get your state pension 14 months before him. There is no sex discrimination.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 06:39;0;6;"Your pension has not been "stolen". Your state pension age was legally equalised with that of men. Yes, that meant you had an increase of 6 years, whereas a man of your age only had a 1-year increase.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 03:18;0;1;"No-one wants to face the reality that DB pension schemes have promised returns that can't be delivered without causing significant economic damage to younger generations."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:53;0;1;"longevity insurance is hugely expensive and of questionable value."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:51;0;1;"And it certainly isn't economically sensible to depress both corporate investment and wages in order to maintain DB scheme benefits that far outstrip the market returns on assets."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:50;0;0;"Yes. They pay more and get less. Meanwhile their wages are squeezed by a continual drain of corporate payments into DB schemes to which they are denied entrance. I can't see how this is politically sustainable."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:40;0;0;"No, what you said had absolutely nothing to do with my original tweet. I was discussing economics, not pensions law. Please read what I actually said, and think about it. This conversation is now closed."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:39;0;0;"But my original point is that DB schemes that drain companies to maintain unaffordable promises depress corporate investment and wages, to the detriment of the economy as a whole. This is not sustainable and will eventually have to change."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:37;0;0;"The sad fact is that if a company has to choose between solvency and supporting its pension fund, it will choose solvency, and the pension trustees will agree with it. That is the reality, regardless of what the law says."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:35;0;0;"What you said had nothing whatsoever to do with my original tweet quote. It was a straw man."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:32;0;0;"You may know about pensions, but you know sweet FA about economic reality - which is what I was discussing. The tweet I quoted was from an economist, not a pensions expert."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:31;0;0;"Rubbish. You missed the point I was making and demolished a straw man of your own creation. Now you are trying to blame me."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:29;0;0;"DB schemes that have made unaffordable promises will not pay out. Benefits will need to be cut to maintain corporate solvency. That is economic reality."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:28;0;0;"In fact, looking back, you missed the point right from the start of this thread. You have been demolishing a straw man. Go back and read my original tweet-quote, including the link, and think about what I actually said."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:27;0;0;"You may know about pensions, but you are completely missing the point I am making."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:26;0;0;"It is simple nonsense to say that a company must support a pension fund at the expense of the interests of its other stakeholders."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:25;0;0;"DB pension schemes cannot and will not be sacrosanct. There is a reckoning to come."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:24;0;0;"You aren't seeing the point, and I'm getting tired of trying to explain it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:24;0;0;"And companies cannot make payments to closed DB schemes if to do so threatens the livelihoods of younger workers who are denied entrance to the scheme. No company can support a DB scheme at the expense of its own solvency, whatever the law says."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:21;0;0;"You are completely missing the point. Closing the DB scheme to new entrants when it gives substantially better benefits than the DC scheme to which new entrants are directed is discrimination. It will eventually be challenged in court."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:20;1;0;"I suggest you have a good look at Carillion's pension funds and the interaction between the trustees and the company. Your statements are simply wrong. Companies like Carillion protect their solvency at the expense of their pension funds."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:16;0;0;"I'm afraid it does have a connection. Ridiculous to say it does not."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:14;0;0;"No, I'm afraid it isn't what happens. If it were, then companies would close their pension deficits. They don't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:13;0;0;"Disagree. The challenge has not come because DC contributors are being promised that the returns of the 1980s will reappear any day now. As time goes on the fact that this is a lie, and DC contributors are being discriminated against, will become apparent."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:11;0;0;"That is clearly unrealistic in practice. No sponsoring company will destroy its own solvency for a pension fund, and no pension fund will expect a sponsoring company to do so. It is not in anyone's interests."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-18 02:05;0;0;"closing DB schemes to new entrants creates discrimination between older and younger employees, especially if the company continues to pay into those schemes at the expense of wages and investment.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 23:33;0;5;"Yes, apparently the RSA researchers thought people in that age group might use the money as an early state pension. So what if they do. It's a reasonable choice to make and none of their bloody business."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 22:12;0;1;"No doubt there would be some who would use it as an early state pension. But equally there would be some women who would use it to enable them to stay at home with their children. Perhaps you should exclude women with children, too?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 22:11;0;0;"Right. Well, I am in the age group you arbitrarily exclude, and I can tell you now that I would not use that money as an early state pension. How dare you make such baseless assumptions about me and others of my age?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 22:08;0;0;"Let me be clear. If this proposal went ahead as currently specified, I would launch a legal challenge on grounds of age discrimination."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 22:08;0;0;"You did not have to impose an unjustifiable cut-off at a completely arbitrary age. You could have set the limit at the age at which people already qualify for a basic income. That would make sense, which this doesn't. I can't support this proposal as it stands."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 22:03;0;0;"I feel pretty strongly about this. If this proposal were implemented in its present form, I would launch a legal challenge on grounds of age discrimination."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:59;0;0;"I think you should stop trying to control how people use the money and set the limit at the age at which people already receive a basic income. Currently that is 65 for men and slightly lower for women, but by 2020 it will have risen to 66 for both."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:58;0;0;"Excluding people from a scheme because you think they might make the "wrong" decision about how to use the money is a fundamental violation of the principle of # UBI, which is that people are free to make their own decisions."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:56;0;0;"also there is no provision whatsoever in law for anyone to "access a state pension early". This paragraph is simply wrong."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:55;0;1;"I would add that you should not exclude people from a scheme purely because you don't like the purpose for which they might use the money.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:54;0;0;"I would recommend excluding those aged 65 and over from the scheme, since they already receive a form of basic income."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:53;0;0;"unless the state pension age were raised by far more than current plans, workers aged 55-65 would lose out considerably from this scheme. Please rethink."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:52;0;0;"Workers aged 55 currently have a state pension age of 67, so will not receive their state pension for another 12 years. Even those currently in their 60s have a state pension age of 66. Excluding them from this scheme is unfair and potentially violates age discrimination law."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:50;0;0;"I am struggling to find any justifiable reason in the report for the limit. It appears arbitrary and discriminatory. Please explain your thinking."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:43;0;0;"I'm disappointed, frankly. I've been an advocate for # UBI for years. But the whole point of # UBI is that it avoids arbitrary discrimination and cliff edges. Why do you want to introduce these?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-16 21:41;0;0;"Reasonable to exclude people aged over 65 from the scheme, because they already receive a basic income in the form of the state pension.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 23:11;1;1;"SPA for the 1950s generation (men and women) has risen by a maximum of 1 year. But longevity has increased by far more. The 1950s generation will have 20-30 years of "quality family time". There is no justification whatsoever for reducing SPA to 63."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 23:01;0;0;"So your moans about state pension age equalisation at 65 and demand for it to be reduced to 63 22 years after the legislation are completely incompatible with the entire concept of # UBI."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 22:59;2;3;"Universal basic income supports work. It presupposes that people who are fit and able to work will do so to supplement their basic income, whatever their age. There would be no "state pension age" in a # UBI system."

You appear to be one of those women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 22:28;0;1;"65 was both the existing state pension age for men, and the state pension age of women prior to 1940. It was eminently fair to equalise at that age, particularly with a 15-year delayed start and a 10-year transition. I'm tired of your whining. You have not been treated badly."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 22:24;0;2;"I am really, really sick of the selfishness and special pleading of women like you. You were in your 30s and 40s when the legislation was announced. You had ample time to prepare for 5 more years' work. Btw equalisation was - and still is - at 65, not 66."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 22:23;0;0;"Not remotely similar. That would include men who had already retired, who had lived through one or even two world wars and the Depression. Their lifespans were significantly shorter than yours and they would effectively lose 2 years of SP without compensation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 22:04;0;0;"btw equalising at 63 with no compensation for older men could not be considered remotely "fair"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 22:04;0;1;"Equalising SPA ended a long-standing discrimination against men. Equalising at 65 avoided additional unfairness towards men who had already suffered from that discrimination. Try looking at this from the perspective of someone other than yourself. It's illuminating."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 22:02;0;0;"That speech did not announce raising SPA. It announced equalising SPA at the existing SPA for men. This avoided creating unfairness for older men who worked till 65, and the 15-year delayed start avoided creating difficulties for older women. It was entirely fair."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 20:36;0;0;"The fact that many couples benefited from the SPA difference was not a reason to maintain it. It's not just single men who resented - many married men did too.

Since GFC, this has reversed somewhat - imho rising asset prices are mildly deflationary now bcs of wage stagnation & tight lending criteria"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 20:27;0;2;"asset price rises can be either inflationary or deflationary depending how ppl respond to them. If wealth effects predominate (helped by easy lending to create liquidity), they can be inflationary. If ppl cut other spending in response to high asset prices, they are deflationary."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 20:25;0;2;"essentially you are confusing stocks and flows. Hyperinflation is a flow distortion - we could call it "hypervelocity". Asset price rises are a balance sheet distortion - those who have assets benefit at the expense of those who don't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 20:20;0;1;"No there aren't. Hyperinflation has a specific definition: http://people.bu.edu/rking/SZGcourse/Cagan.pdf … Asset price rises, including housing, do not meet this definition."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 20:12;0;0;"Expensive housing is not hyperinflation. You don't seem to know what hyperinflation is. If you want to see hyperinflation, go to Venezuela."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 20:11;1;2;"More likely than any sort of stablecoin imho. I've also seen a proposal for a cryptocurrency backed by prepaid energy futures (which are zero-coupon bonds, really). I think that has possibilities."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-15 20:09;0;0;"I do get angry when I'm told that I had "time to plan" or should "start my own campaign". I'm only a few days younger than the youngest 1950s women. I've had exactly the same SPA rise as them and no more notice."

This was because of Labour govt legislation in 2007 to raise SPA by a year for both men & women 2024-2026. Assumed equalisation complete."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 21:11;0;4;"This in a nutshell is the # WASPI problem. Relying on hearsay and not checking facts. That's why they assumed their state pension age was 60 even though it was raised 22 years ago."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 21:09;0;4;"Many of these women don't know the facts and rely on hearsay. So they will tell you that their SPA is now 67, because they have heard somewhere that the SPA is rising to 67. They don't bother to check their own SPA or ask for a state pension forecast."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 21:07;1;3;"I'd also recommend reading the excellent Commons Library's briefing papers on women's state pensions. This is from November: http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7405 …"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 21:02;0;2;"Some women have a rise of up to 18 months in their SPA on top of the 1995 rise, due to the 2011 Tory/LD acceleration. But those women had lower SPAs under the 1995 transition. The rest have a rise of 12 months on top of the 1995 rise."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 20:59;6;12;"Not true. Maximum state pension age for # 1950s women is 66th birthday. That's a rise of exactly 6 years. Of that, 5 years is due to legislation brought in by the 1995 Conservative government and not repealed by the subsequent Labour government.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 20:56;0;0;"I'd say so, yes. Returns to existing HODLers depend entirely on a constant inflow of new buyers. So they are strongly incentivised to market the product to potential buyers. Hence hostility towards critics. It's an unregulated direct marketing scheme."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 20:52;0;1;"No. It should have been equalised at 63 in 1983 when the Equalities Commission recommended it. House of Commons debated it without a vote. Government ducked it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 20:51;1;12;"Women's SPA was reduced to 60 in 1940 to prevent the household income of men with younger wives falling off a cliff when they retired.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 20:22;0;1;"For those who won't inherit, problem is high rentals and insecurity. Solution would be much more social housing at (proper) affordable rents, really."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 20:20;0;1;"Problems are 1) timing (inheritance too late to establish a family) 2) high rentals until inheritance 3) risk that inheritance is eroded by social care costs.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 17:49;0;0;"By all means be prepared. So, how are you going to protect millions of older working class people whose only significant asset is their house?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 17:29;0;0;"Also please stop assuming that London is representative of the whole country. As I pointed out to Laurie, house prices are very skewed because of the "magnetic London" effect. Your piece ignores this."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 17:26;0;0;"Perhaps you also might do some modelling on the market effects of rent controls. You don't mention that the singe biggest objection to rent controls is that it tightens rental supply, which can lead to rationing, reduced labour mobility and rising homelessness."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 17:21;0;0;"Your piece does not discuss lowering prices gradually. It envisages a crash caused by legislation to improve tenants rights. Please model what you are actually proposing."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 17:18;0;0;"But you don't anywhere explain why a fall in BTL supply would cause a general house price crash."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 17:15;0;0;"No, you don't. You explain why a fall in house prices would hurt households with large mortgages (true, it would) while ignoring the rest. The point I have repeatedly made now is that it is not just the highly mortgaged who would be hurt."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 17:09;0;0;"Ok, so you think introducing rent controls would induce a house price crash. Afaik there is no case in history of rent control imposition inducing a crash, but I guess this tine could be different. But it you are right, it would not be "gentle deflation", would it?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 16:52;0;0;"Don't you think "softening the blow" for those currently close to neg equity while letting those who suffered 5 years of neg equity in the 1990s take yet another house price hit would be unfair? Those taking the second hit would certainly think so."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 16:48;0;0;"Again, you miss the point. I am not discussing those close to neg equity. I am saying a large fall in house prices would be extremely damaging for older people with no other assets. Do you think they don't matter?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 16:44;0;0;"And you are completely ignoring the considerable harm that such a crash would do to larger numbers of older working class people whose only significant asset is their house."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 16:42;0;0;"A fall in house prices large enough to make a significant difference to rents is a crash."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 16:37;0;0;"Improving tenants' rights is likely to reduce the supply of properties for rent. Historically that has always been the effect. It's possible that tightening rental supply might cause a house price fall, but equally it might cause a rise if more people buy instead of renting."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 16:32;0;0;"As I said, you seem to think the BTL market is much larger than it is. Primary residences are by far the largest part of the market. You need to explain why improving tenants' rights would affect those."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 11:35;4;8;"No it isn't. It's an angry rant by an angry woman who thinks her experience is the experience of all aid workers' families and who has frankly repellent ideas about what constitutes "normal".https://twitter.com/citysamuel/status/963553162757050368 …"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 11:15;0;0;"I'm also failing to see why improving tenants' rights would cause a housing crash. You seem to think the BTL market is the majority of the housing market. It isn't. By far the biggest proportion is people buying primary residences."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 11:11;0;0;"Massive increase in homes could not cause a housing crash. It could slow the rate of price increase, but unless govt built the houses it could not reduce prices. Lead times too long, and builders won't build into a falling market. Even housing associations won't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 11:07;0;1;"There have already been measures to curb speculation, notably the April 16 stamp duty hike for second homes and BTL property. Are you aware of that? It is the main reason why London house prices have been falling."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 11:03;0;0;"You clearly don't think that depriving older working class people of their only significant wealth is damaging. I beg to differ."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 11:00;0;0;"I did not say it could. But neither would engineering a house price crash, as you propose, without other measures as well. Let's compare like with like, please."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 08:01;0;0;"No. I think house prices will eventually reach equilibrium. In fact I think they might have done so already had Osborne not pumped them up with FLS and H2B."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-14 07:59;0;0;"I am in favour of taxing unearned gains on property, with the option for retired people of deferring the tax and paying it from the estate after death."

Should he have his state pension now, because she has retired? Obviously not. So why should a woman with an older husband?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-12 18:47;0;1;"Expectation now is that both husband and wife will work until their respective SPAs. The days when married women were not expected to work are long gone. I think some 1950s women are failing to understand that fundamental shift in expectations."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-12 18:44;0;2;"But now, the majority of married women work, so the hit to income if their husbands retire on state pension only is not so large. Also, as you say, many of their husbands have occupational pensions as well. Expectation now is not that wives retire younger, but that wives work."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-12 18:42;0;2;"Bottom line is this. Earlier SPA of women was only justifiable when a) most women were married b) few married women worked. It prevented households where the man was older than the woman having a large fall in income when he retired."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-12 18:39;0;1;"Lots of those women will effectively benefit from their husbands' occupational pensions, simply because they live together. Why give them an earlier state pension as well?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 10:16;0;0;"FFS.

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:56;0;1;"I'm afraid once other tech overtakes it - and it will imho - Bitcoin will have no intrinsic value. In a way, those who see it as "digital gold" understand this. But they don't see that it is not enough like gold for network effects alone to maintain its value."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:52;0;1;"Thanks!"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:52;0;0;"It doesn't even eliminate that. What do you think an exchange is? And what do you think an intermediate channel in a multi-hop LN payment route is?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:50;0;0;"Umm, physical cash is an enabler and a hedge. Welfare cost of eliminating it is extremely high. Don't go there."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:41;0;0;"I admire your faith, but I don't share it. I think monetary use of blockchain is a blind alley."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:40;0;0;"Yes....which supports my argument that it is a risky speculative asset. Why can't you see this?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:39;0;0;"Oh, and I'm well aware of the SEC and CTFC involvement, too."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:38;0;1;"Currently the only use of Bitcoin is as a speculative asset, and all its value comes from that. It's not as useful as a means of payment as it was five years ago, because its price is now too high and volatile. I am not discussing altcoins."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:35;0;0;"Do you patronise everyone who disagrees with you? I'm very well informed about Ethereum, thanks. I don't need to "study" it."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:29;1;2;"It's an asset. People buy it to hold, not to spend. They want to profit from its price appreciation and they don't care about liquidity. It's useless as a currency because its price is too high and volatile, transaction fees are too high and settlement time is too variable."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:25;0;0;"Now, do you have a sensible comment to make?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:24;0;0;"I did not say they were not a wise long term investment. Risky speculative assets have a place in a well-balanced portfolio. But of course you need to do your due diligence on the assets. Blindly buying risky assets simply because everyone else is buying them is a bad strategy."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:21;0;0;"We are not discussing the US dollar."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:18;0;0;"Utterly boring comment."
Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:18;0;0;"Indeed, the fact that it is new and exciting is what attracts people to it as a speculative asset."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 09:01;0;0;"It doesn't, because it is virtually useless as a means of payment. Use value destroyed by the fact that it has become a speculative asset."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-08 08:48;0;0;"Furthermore, your own comment doesn't address the point I made either. I dont think you've even read it. Too busy congratulating your idiot friend on his stupid ad hominem. The pair of you are pathetic."

Frances_Coppola;2018-02-01 19:34;12;22;"I need to look at other outsourcers' balance sheets to support my moral hazard theory, obviously. I reckon they all look alike - high debt, large goodwill assets, large pension deficits, unstable cash flow, front-loaded profits and dividends paid from debt."

Now Carillion is in default, suppliers have been left with a big pile of unsecured debt instead of their invoice payments."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 20:04;0;0;"YES. The other side of this is the scheme's (involuntary) long position in the company's debt. Short stock position is effectively an equity hedge - arguably a wise move when the sponsor's financial position looks shaky."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 20:01;0;4;"Close, yes, but imho more likely mismanagement. Over-optimistic view of future cash flows on existing contracts, declared as profits under percentage-of-completion accounting and thus justifying dividend."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 19:44;0;1;"It's not illegal to borrow cash to pay a dividend, provided that declared profits justify it. It may be unwise, though, and in 2016 it clearly was. Surprised the auditor didn't query it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 19:42;0;1;"Dunno. Haven't looked."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 19:41;0;0;"Oh absolutely. As I said, if Blackrock really was betting against its own clients, that is a very serious matter indeed, and needs to be exposed. I just think there are good reasons why shorting the sponsoring company's stock might be in its clients' best interests."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 19:38;0;0;"it depends on the circumstances, yes. But in this case, with a pension scheme in deficit and the sponsoring company's financial position deteriorating, it would act as a kind of stop-loss insurance.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:52;0;0;"That's implied in the going concern basis, surely?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:49;0;1;"I'd say KPMG's report was designed to cover their own backs rather than draw attention to the company's problems. No doubt in my mind that they knew it was in trouble, but decided to keep quiet and pray it recovered."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:48;0;0;"But they weren't. KPMG drew attention to the risks, rambled on about what they did themselves to investigate the key audit points, but stopped short of querying the going concern basis."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:46;0;0;"Then you don't understand financial markets and my original comment stands."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:44;0;1;"I'd call resolutely maintaining a long position when the company financials are deteriorating "gambling for resurrection", personally."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:43;0;0;"It's absolutely not in scheme members' bests interests for the fund to hold a long position when the scheme is in deficit and the sponsoring company's financial position as revealed in its report & accounts is deteriorating."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:42;0;0;"Yes, and "best interest" could include shorting the sponsoring company's stock, if the scheme is in deficit. Look you need to understand the insurance-like nature of a short position."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:41;0;0;"The confusion is entirely yours. You are alleging that fund managers short the stock for their own profit while holding a long position for their clients. That is a breach of trust - shall we put it like that, to avoid arguing over terminology?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:39;0;0;"@ workercapital is not seeing that a short position in the company's stock when a fund is in deficit is stop-loss insurance. But Blackrock would understand this."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:38;0;0;"Yes I do. You don't understand the role of shorting."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:37;0;0;"whatever. Their responsibility is to the scheme members, not to the sponsoring company. If they judge the best interests of the scheme members are served by shorting the sponsoring company's stock, how is this a conflict of interest?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:36;0;0;"You do not know that their proprietary position was long, which is what you are alleging."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:35;0;0;"It could be in the interests of scheme members if the fund is in deficit. Think about it. Maybe John could comment on whether pension scheme trustees are prohibited by law from taking a short position in the stock of a sponsoring company?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:33;4;5;"This is an extremely serious assertion. You had better have watertight evidence. Fund manager betting against its clients for its own profit is a major failure of fiduciary duty.https://twitter.com/WorkerCapital/status/957922747702743040 …"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:31;0;0;"Seems to me it is you who is being hypothetical. Do you have evidence that Blackrock was betting against its own clients?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:29;0;0;"You have to remember that Blackrock's fiduciary duty is to the scheme's members, not to the sponsoring company or its shareholders. So it is not a conflict of interest to short the stock, as Unison allege."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:24;0;1;""
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:24;0;0;"Think it through. Short position on sponsoring company stock can be protective for a scheme in deficit. Sort of stop-loss insurance. Would you rather it bought CDS on its lending to the company (which is what the deficit is, in effect)?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 18:20;0;0;"I would say so, yes. I was thinking about this. UNISON's criticism is only valid if there is no possibility of the company failing - which implies government support. If the company can fail, shorting it (maybe with put options) is a stop-loss position for the scheme."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-29 11:13;15;37;"Dividends were paid as a percentage of declared profits. The problem was that the declared profits were estimated on the basis of future cash flows, not on cash actually received. So the company had to borrow against them to raise cash for the dividend."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 20:11;0;0;"Indirectly, yes. But I don't think any rules have been broken. Problem is accounting standards for goodwill can have the effect of bringing future income streams on to the balance sheet."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 20:02;0;1;"I haven't yet. Looking at Capita was quite bad enough. This whole industry stinks."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 20:01;0;0;"I don't accept that. But even if I did, I wouldn't agree that disruptive new tech has to break the law. It may run ahead of the law, but the law will eventually catch up. And it certainly shouldn't be explicitly designed to break the law. That invites clampdown."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:53;0;2;"See the first paragraph. This is aimed at the people who are trying to blame the banks and the Government for Carillion's failure. Competent financial analysts knew it was going down, of course - that's why the stock was being shorted."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:50;0;0;"indeed.....and the EPF under which suppliers were drawing early payments was collateralised by a Carillion liability. Nowhere in the EPF documentation does it discuss what would happen if Carillion defaulted."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:35;0;0;"to be fair, competent analysts saw it coming. Stock was being shorted from 2015 onwards."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:34;0;0;"umm, I'd say the balance sheet dressing up misleads far more people than that. Hence "no-one saw it coming" re Carillion, when the signs were evident in the 2016 accounts (and probably before that too, I haven't looked)."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:32;0;1;"Maybe. But it is the reason why there are no assets to sell, and therefore why senior creditors stand to lose almost all of their money - which was my point."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:24;0;0;"I look at everything. Agree that usually P&L and cash flow matter more. But in Carillion's case, the structure of the balance sheet does matter. It's the primary reason for its insolvency."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:19;0;1;"lesson no.1 from Carillion: never, ever leverage goodwill."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:18;0;0;"I know there is always a link between cash flow and balance sheet, bcs distressed companies sell assets to meet current obligations. But in Carillion's case it was far worse, because adverse movements in FUTURE cash flows destroyed asset value."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:16;0;1;"Especially in a company whose asset value entirely depends on projected future cash flows. When cash flow shrinks, so does the asset value. That really was the point of my post. Toxic link between cash flow and balance sheet."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:12;0;1;"It's on the balance sheet."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:10;0;0;"Goodwill wasn't impaired at all until June 2017. Small increase in goodwill in 2016 accounts due to finalisation of an acquisition agreement entered into in 2015 (see note 29)"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:04;0;1;"yes. I can't see how they can avoid NAO censure for wasting public funds."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 19:03;0;1;"Yep. This is what Carillion has done. The SPCs I mentioned are associated with joint ventures. It's a complex and opaque balance sheet structure set up to exploit the dodgier aspects of equity accounting."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 18:56;0;2;"My guess is that there is a grey area between purchased and inherent goodwill, particularly in relation to joint ventures, which Carillion has exploited to flatter its balance sheet."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 18:55;0;0;"Oh, I think that is certain. What is unclear is the reason. Was it just negligence, or was govt trying to keep Carillion afloat?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 18:53;0;0;"They also appear to be revaluing goodwill not just impairing it, which is also dodgy. The more I find out about at this the more I wonder whether KPMG bothered to look under the surface, as an auditor should."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-20 18:51;0;0;"Have a look at the accounts (link at the foot of the post). I think they have fudged the distinction. Without going back years I can't prove it, but goodwill appears too high to come only from acquisitions - especially as they didn't have any in 2016."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-19 06:28;0;0;"In 2014, the Coalition govt raised the state pension age of men and women born 5/4/60 onwards to 67. This was really acceleration of another state pension age rise legislated by the Labour govt in 2007."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-19 05:37;0;0;"Fair point. From the sender's POV, though, the possibility of not finding a route at all is worrying. I suppose the backstop would be to send the payment directly via Bitcoin, assuming the sender has free coins available (since she can't use channel funds)."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-19 05:28;0;0;"Yes yes, I know that. You are seeing this as a sequence, whereas I am looking at the probabilities.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-19 05:18;0;0;"I agree that path selection eliminates the recursion problem. But it does not eliminate the other problem I identified, which is that you may simply be unable to find a path at all. And it doesn't eliminate the performance overhead from trying multiple routes."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-19 05:15;0;0;"this is simple maths. You may have a number of possible paths. You don't in advance know which one (if any) you will be able to use, because if any node declines, the path must change."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-19 05:13;0;1;"I'm sorry, but we are confusing ex ante and ex post here. The initial choice of path is not random. But the eventual choice of path is effectively random, since you don't know whether people will accept or decline the invitation."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 22:31;0;0;"In fact this is how Visa and Mastercard came to dominate the current payments network. They are two very large hubs that have millions of spokes. Your system will inevitably go the same way."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 22:30;0;0;"You are ignoring how people make choices. Fewer, larger hubs is more efficient, so although you start off with lots of hubs, over time they will reduce. You will end up with a lot of spokes and very few hubs."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 18:31;0;1;"heh, it's both. "I have a computer science degree, so that gives me the right to pontificate" is appeal to authority. "Your computer science degree is rubbish" is ad hominem. It's a put-down, anyway."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 18:29;0;1;"adding layers obviously slows down final settlement. Faster Payment periodically broadcasts batched & netted transactions to CHAPS for final settlement, and that settles within 2 hours. Lightning seems to do something very similar for Bitcoin."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 18:25;0;0;"That's only because of the layering in traditional systems. Settlement finality in a double-entry RTGS system at a central bank is instantaneous."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 18:12;0;1;"Yes, but debt/GDP is a ridiculous measure. Even households can borrow for investment on the basis of expected future income. Why should govt's borrowing be limited by current income?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 18:09;2;3;"Bitcoin was fast back in the day. Speed was one of its major USPs. Now it has become slow and expensive, because lots more people are using it.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 05:08;17;7;"That means that Carillion's SME suppliers, instead of being paid as they thought, have had a large amount of unsecured debt dumped on them.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 04:24;0;1;"Looks like Carillion (and probably others too) took advantage of the Govt's scheme to screw their suppliers.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-18 03:54;0;0;"The link you provided said that Lloyds operated a set-off arrangement whereby it could reduce payment to a supplier by the amount of anything owed to Lloyds by the supplier.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-16 19:18;0;0;"That resulted in SPA of 66th birthday for women born 6/10/54 onwards. The 2014 Act then raised SPA again, to 67, for women and men born 6/4/60 onwards. # WASPI women are not affected by the 2014 Act, but many think they are because they have seen the rises reported "in the media"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-16 19:16;0;0;"As you wrongly believe her SPA is over 66, I am wondering if you have confused the 2011 and 2014 Pension Acts. The 2011 Act added a maximum of 18 months to the SPA of women born between 6/4/53 and 5/4/55, and 1 year to the SPA of women born 6/4/55 onwards."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-16 19:15;0;3;"Also, second rise was in 2011. If she was 58 before that rise, as you suggest, then she would have been born in 1952 or 53 and should already have her state pension. From what you say she was born later than that, so by the time she was 58 the 2011 Act had already been passed."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-16 19:11;0;5;"I agree the second rise was harsh. But it was not 3 years as you allege. What she found out "from the media" was not right for her.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-15 06:38;0;1;"Then I'm sure you can understand why they might be less than enthusiastic about paying for you to have pension from 60."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-15 06:34;0;1;"we need to reform working-age benefits. Conditionality is much too harsh for older people.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-15 05:59;0;0;"Government does not personally inform about legislation. Not receiving a letter doesn't mean people can't find out. I was only informed in 2015 that my SPA had risen by 6 years. That is less than 5 years' notice. But I already knew."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-15 05:50;0;4;"It would also be grossly unjust for a woman born in December 1959 to receive 6 years of bridging pension while her classmate born January 1960, whose SPA has also risen by 6 years and who was likewise not notified, receives nothing."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-15 05:48;1;4;"In my view it would be grossly unjust for well-off 1950s women to receive unconditional payments while 1950s men on low incomes, for whom women's SPA rises deprive them of their right to claim pension credit, get nothing."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-15 05:46;0;4;"That is not only true of 1950s women. My view is that people who are struggling financially because of SPA rises should have targeted help, irrespective of age or gender. I don't like the exclusive focus on 1950s women."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-14 05:33;1;2;"Not really. If they go down the banks won't like it, but they are (or should be) sufficiently well capitalised to take the hit. And government can award the contracts elsewhere or take them in-house. I see no justification for bailing Carillion out."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-14 05:31;9;18;"bank lending would have been far higher, or the company would have been obviously in trouble much sooner, had trade payables not risen by £400m in 2016. Suppliers squeezed to keep company afloat."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-14 05:29;9;17;"Notes to the accounts show that short-term bank lending rose to 65m in 2016 - approx. five-fold increase. Indicates Carillion had serious cash flow problems."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-14 05:24;14;16;"Also, pension deficit doubled in 2016 to £810m, mainly due to revaluation of closed defined-benefit schemes. They don't appear to have any coherent plan for closing it."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-12 05:21;0;1;"Britain officially abolished workhouses in 1930 but took some years to run them down. With workhouses gone, older single women could end up begging on the streets. Hence campaign to lower state pension age for women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-12 05:19;0;0;"we still had workhouses in the 1930s in Britain. One of the reasons for lowering women's state pension age to 60 was that single women in their late 50s/early 60s often ended up in workhouses."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-12 05:04;0;1;"The ban on outdoor relief was the direct cause of serious overcrowding of workhouses in the Irish famine of 1846-51."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-12 04:14;0;0;"Outdoor relief was officially banned in Great Britain in the 1834 Poor Law Act, and in Ireland in the 1838 Act. The ban was widely flouted by parishes though."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-12 04:12;5;21;"In which I sort of agree with Toby Young. He was indeed the target of a political attack. But that was because his appointment to OfS was political.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-12 03:39;0;1;"Yes! Seems incredible now, but the 1908 state pension was fiercely opposed on the grounds that it would discourage work. It was means tested, character tested and had SPA of 70 for both men and women. So opponents thought people over 70 who lacked means should work or starve."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 23:11;0;0;"Exactly. It does assume that people generally want to work. But the overwhelming evidence is that they do. That was the point of my Irish thread."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 23:02;0;2;"Same principle though. Point is, steep tapers are a serious disincentive to seek more and better-paid work. But instead of flattening the tapers, the Government prefers to threaten people."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 22:28;1;1;"The point was that people want to work. The author of the Times article said UBI would destroy the incentive to work. That is not true."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 22:16;0;2;"Absolutely. I see UBI as the "floor" of a completely redesigned taxation and welfare system. It's not compatible with the present spaghetti system."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 22:14;0;0;"I think the 19th century Irish attitude was similar. "I want work, not handouts." Means testing is demeaning."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 22:12;0;0;"Absolutely. You can't credibly detach UBI from taxation."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 22:11;0;0;"that's quite late. They had lived through the famine, then."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 22:10;0;0;"Better to combine UBI with progressive taxation, so UBI is effectively taxed away at higher incomes."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 22:10;0;0;"Having to ask can cause starvation - we know that benefit take-up is a big problem, particularly among older people. And means testing can disincentivise better paid and more productive work - people lose too much of the gains to make it worth their while."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:57;1;1;"Long before that. There was fierce opposition to the introduction of a basic old age pension in 1908 because it "disincentivised work". The state pension age being discussed was 70 for both men and women. In 1908. Seriously."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:55;0;0;"that's why UBI is better than means tested benefits. Very high marginal tax rates as benefits are withdrawn disincentivise more productive work and trap people at the bottom of the income distribution. Poor benefit design."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:54;0;1;"no, I mean importer. However, the imported grain was lower quality than the exported grain, and it didn't reach the people who needed it. Lots of it stayed stuck in Government stores."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:53;0;1;"But I was struck by the "people need to be forced to work through the threat of starvation" attitude of the Times piece. My point was that they don't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:52;0;0;"At the time there were also proposals to reclaim bogland and turn it into productive farmland, and proposals to build railways. Those would have been good schemes too. UBI is not a panacea."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:50;0;2;"It might have enabled them to educate their children, improving the skills of future generations. It might have enabled them to start cottage industries or shops. It might have enabled them to move to where there were real jobs."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:48;0;1;"Giving the Irish UBI might have made them less dependent on the potato. It might have enabled them to graze a cow, or diversify their crops. It might have prevented them pawning their clothes for food."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:47;0;1;"people hate doing jobs that are only created to give them employment. They would rather look for productive jobs that use their skills properly - but they can't do that if they lack the means to live."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:45;0;0;"The second point is that job guarantee programmes don't work. If a job is worth doing, it is ALWAYS worth doing - not just when there are lots of unemployed."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:44;0;0;"The point is that people want to work. UBI at a low level is not going to destroy that."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:23;4;7;"At the same time as the British government was trying to "discipline" the "lazy" Irish by restricting famine relief, a French railway company advertised for Irish workers, because in France, Irish labourers were the best."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:20;3;9;"But only the British saw the Irish as lazy indigents that just wanted to depend on the state. In other countries, the Irish diaspora (pre-famine) were seen as strong, hard-working and decent. They were in demand as workers."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:17;1;5;"The myth of Irish "laziness" significantly influenced political decisions at the time. Relief was too little, too late, in part because politicians thought the Irish needed to be "disciplined" into "taking responsibility for themselves"."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:14;6;8;"The myth that the Irish were "lazy" and lacked a good work ethic was promoted by the Tory press of the time, who represented landowners who wanted to justify not providing relief (because they would have to pay for it)."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:10;1;4;"The men wanted the dignity of doing productive work that paid enough to give them and their families a decent life. Giving them food destroyed that dignity. So did creating unnecessary jobs for them to do."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:07;1;5;"But the road building programme was also unpopular. It didn't pay enough, but that wasn't the main problem. The real issue was that it was deliberately unproductive. The men's work achieved nothing. They knew that, and hated it."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:04;2;11;"The reason for the riots? The men didn't want to be given food, they wanted to work for it. They wanted jobs that paid them enough to keep their families. Soup kitchens destroyed the little dignity they had left."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:02;1;2;"There were riots at the soup kitchens as they were being constructed. Some of the soup boilers were broken."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 21:01;3;5;"In 1847, at the height of the Irish famine, the British government stopped the road building programme which employed Irish labourers at below-subsistence wages, replacing it with soup kitchens."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:44;0;0;"My guess is that "USD backing" would most likely be USTs/Tbills.But 100% reserve would be impossible to maintain on a marked-to-market basis if backing was entirely USTs/Tbills."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:40;0;1;"And if the backer is a regulated bank, then we have implicit Fed guarantee for an asset issued by an unregulated private sector entity. Oh look, shadow banking all over again."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:38;0;1;"And why do you assume that "100% USD backing" for a cryptocurrency would necessarily be in monetary base? Unless the backer is a regulated bank, that is one heck of a lot of paper."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:35;0;0;"I mean reserve backing, obviously."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:34;0;0;"1) if price is rising rapidly, private sector entity may not be able to maintain 100% reserve vs market price (this is the case currently). 2) why should we trust that anything is 100% reserve backed, unless Fed is involved?"

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:28;0;1;"It's an oxymoron."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:28;0;3;"The last time the private sector claimed 100% reserve banking for assets it issued, it didn't end too well. Thought we weren't going to do that again."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:26;0;3;"Because the Fed does not guarantee 100% reserve backing for any other privately-issued asset, or for any foreign currency. Why make an exception for cryptocurrencies?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 10:24;1;2;"Bitcoin can be useful for high-value cross-currency payments. IMHO not worth it for single-currency transactions in major currencies."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 09:52;1;4;"hopefully cryptocurrencies will disrupt banks enough to force them to make radical improvements to international payments. Have to say though that extreme price volatility seriously discourages cryptocurrency use for payments. FX risk is massive."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 09:47;0;2;"I agree with that, but the discrepancy only exists because it was not in banks' interests to improve international payments."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-11 09:46;0;2;"I know correspondent banking is slow and expensive, though that's largely because banks have zero incentive to improve it.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-07 05:05;0;0;"No. The sidelining of exceptional women, and denial of education and opportunity to women in general, long pre-dates IQ tests. These women are mostly lost to history - though a few are being rediscovered, which is how we know about women being sidelined."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-07 04:58;0;0;"You have no evidence that the bell curve of brown men is shifted to the left relative to that of white men. And even if it is, you cannot prove that the difference is not due to lack of education and opportunity - as it was for women."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-07 04:57;0;0;"But that was not the "received wisdom" of days gone by. Women were believed to be intrinsically less intelligent than men - ie the bell curve was shifted to the left. We now know that was ENTIRELY because they were denied education and opportunity."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-07 04:50;0;0;"The same arguments were historically used to justify male privilege, too. Women were "innately" less intelligent. Fact they were denied education and opportunity had nothing to do with it, of course. We now know this is total bollocks (I choose this term carefully)."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-07 04:06;0;1;"You have no justification whatosever for looking at those figures and assuming that causation runs from IQ to economic performance. As poverty is known to lower measured IQ, it is more likely to run the other way."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-07 03:52;0;0;"It is racist to allege that non-European migrants have lower IQ. IQ tests are themselves class and race biased, and therefore unreliable.

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-04 13:03;0;0;"The "randomness" that the writer says is impossible is in fact intrinsic. Someone initiating a multi-hop payment doesn't know the path. They only know the destination. Forwarders choose their own paths. So whole path is only defined when payment reaches its destination."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-04 12:50;0;3;"The forwarders can be regarded as full-reserve banks. Because they must forward payments in advance of receiving funds, they cannot handle payments larger than, or totalling more than, their own reserves. So heavy traffic could render a forwarder unresponsive, surely?"
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-04 12:42;0;4;"Risk that a payment fails because forwarder becomes unresponsive in the middle of a payment chain is Herstatt risk, now largely eliminated from mainstream payments systems. As payment fails can have serious welfare consequences, reintroducing Herstatt risk is not progress."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-04 12:36;0;0;"Also, the fact that there are multiple possible payment paths does not necessarily mean the network would be distributed. A hub-and-spoke structure can have multiple payment paths."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-02 22:59;0;1;"the building society model worked because it invested the time deposits of risk-averse savers in residential property, a long-term investment which is low-risk over the retirement savings time horizon. Business investment is shorter-term and much higher risk."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-02 22:57;0;1;"Most seriously of all: there is a fundamental behavioural mismatch between lenders wanting a return and businesses needing to invest. Time deposit savers are typically saving for retirement and therefore risk averse. Businesses need lenders to take risk."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-02 22:54;0;1;"what they describe there is not a 100% reserve banking system. That would be one in which banks lend only from own funds, not from deposits. Time deposits are still deposits."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-02 22:53;0;1;"Time deposit lending is the thrift model (building societies, in the UK). Nothing new about that whatsoever. Building societies didn't offer demand deposits (transaction accounts) until the 1980s. Many still don't."
Frances_Coppola;2018-01-02 22:50;0;0;"quick look - it's dreadfully wrong. Banks don't "lend out" money from demand deposit accounts, for starters. The only demand deposit balance that changes when banks lend is that on the borrower's account."

Frances_Coppola;2018-01-02 22:45;0;2;"Growing economies can't cope with a rigidly fixed money supply. People start to use other things as money, such as IOUs. Intermediaries such as pawnbrokers help them to do this. Remember that in the UK, banks were originally goldsmiths."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-31 21:17;2;8;"In Ireland, corn prices rose even higher due to price gouging by merchants. The Government refused to intervene to bring down the price even to international levels, preferring to worship at the altar of "free trade"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-31 21:16;0;6;"Part of the reason for high prices was crop failures and export bans all over Europe in 1846, which severely restricted supply and caused an international price spike. In Britain, this triggered a banking crisis and temporary suspension of the gold standard in 1847."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-31 21:14;0;2;"In practice, as the quotation shows, that meant no release of Government grain stores even where private sector supplies were very limited. Prices shot up far beyond the reach of those who were starving."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-31 21:12;0;2;"But the new Whig government led by Lord John Russell was ideologically opposed to any interference with prices. It restricted sale of Government food to areas where there was no food at all available from the private sector."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-31 21:11;1;1;"In 1845-6, Peel's government had bought low-grade corn on the open market and sold it gradually at below market prices to bring down the price of corn in Ireland. This did offer some relief."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 19:58;0;3;"They resolve it by pretending care somehow magically happens when government support is removed. To them, there is no opportunity cost. The unspoken belief underlying this is that women don't need paid work and don't deserve careers."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 19:51;0;1;"This is the key point: "Approximately 20% of mothers receive some pensions while around 30% work. The remaining 50% is either unemployed or not participating". Very low female participation rate. That's how Mamma does it all. She doesn't do paid work."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 19:45;0;0;"What answer do you get?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 19:44;0;0;"Trouble is, last time we tried this thousands died. That's why I have been discussing the social context of the Corn Laws repeal. It's surprisingly relevant."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 19:09;0;1;"I think he sees Brexit as the start of a process of dismantling government and making even very small communities responsible for themselves - radical localism. Dominic Cummings expressed similar views."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 19:01;0;3;"So what his idea of social reform consists of is hundreds of thousands of women leaving the workforce to provide unpaid care for the elderly, sick and disabled. I don't call that progress."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 18:58;0;0;"Perhaps, but think about what he is saying about women. His mum spent her life making dinners for elderly people on her street. So she wasn't working, was she? My mum did meals on wheels for the elderly. She wasn't working either."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 18:54;0;2;"Because they expect women to do unpaid care instead of - or as well as - paid work. Didn't you notice the implied misogyny in Pete's tweet?"

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:25;0;1;"To reduce their wage and tax bills in the face of crashing rents, falling grain prices and rising taxes, they evicted their tenants and turned over the land to grazing. This helped the poor how, exactly?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:23;0;0;"I'm not sure relying on devaluation to absorb unit labour cost differences works all that well in a globalised world anyway."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:23;0;0;"I didn't mention this, but mid-19th century Britain also had fixed exchange rates - a gold standard. So devaluation to absorb unit labour cost differences between countries under free trade wasn't possible."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:19;3;8;"Thus the repeal of the Corn Laws was part of the austerity programme that resulted in the deaths of over a million people in the Irish famine."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:18;3;5;"Remember that tax rises are austerity, just as much as spending cuts."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:17;2;4;"As one landowner put it, it became "evict or be evicted"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:17;2;2;"Many of the landowners were highly indebted. The deadly combination of crashing rents, falling land prices and rising taxes meant they faced default and eviction if they did not find a more profitable use for their land."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:15;2;4;"At the same time as grain prices were falling, the UK government imposed massive property tax hikes on Irish landowners to pay for poor relief."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:13;2;5;"As grain prices fell, tillage (grain crops) became uneconomic and farm rents crashed. Landowners evicted thousands of tenants, often in the middle of winter and with no notice."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:11;2;4;"The repeal of the Corn Laws took three years. During that time, Ireland's food exports to mainland Britain remained protected. But once the Corn Laws had gone, Ireland's agrarian economy, already damaged by the famine, was fully exposed to international competition."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:09;3;3;"That's why grain was so scarce in Ireland. Contrary to popular belief, Ireland was a net importer of grain in 1847, not an exporter. However, I digress."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:03;4;4;"In 1847, the worst year of the famine, countries all over Europe stopped exports because of crop failures - grain as well as potato. The prices of both soared."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:02;5;5;"The Corn Laws protected Irish food exports from external competition, keeping prices higher than they otherwise would have been. Workers in mainland Britain paid more for food, but this enabled Irish farm labourers to pay their rents."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-30 00:00;2;2;"As people went back to the land, Ireland became a largely agrarian economy. Because it was part of the Union, it exported food tariff-free to mainland UK."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:58;3;7;"Ireland deindustrialised in the early 19th century, as its industries (notably linen) couldn't compete with mainland Britain's expanding industrial sector."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:57;2;3;"The second phase of the famine was largely caused by tenant evictions as landowners' rents crashed, not by crop failure. 2/n"

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:53;0;0;"I think the problem in northern England was similar - not enough workhouses, so local authorities and philanthropists created a variety of make-work schemes to avoid restrictions on outdoor relief. There are "famine roads" in Lancashire, built during the Cotton Famine."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:51;0;1;"Absolutely. Though I think you are wrong about the Poor Laws. The 1834 reform applied to Northern England. In 1838 it was even extended to Ireland. The lack of workhouses combined with legal restriction of outdoor relief was the reason for the "roads to nowhere" programme."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:49;0;0;"The Tories were generally opposed to Corn Law repeal. Unsurprisingly, since they were predominantly landed gentry. Robert Peel's decision to support repeal brought down the Tory government. It's still a mystery why he changed his mind."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:39;8;11;"And in Ireland, "work must pay" forced starving men to work on roads to nowhere, for rates of pay too low to pay for food."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:38;7;17;"But we know what the consequences of the austerity of the mid-19th century were. "Work must pay" is a race to the bottom. In England and Wales, starving workhouse inhabitants were found eating the bones they had been assigned to grind down as fertilizer."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:36;7;15;"And unilaterally cutting tariffs to zero to force down prices by flooding the place with cheap imports is part of the "fool the workers" scheme too. If price falls can be engineered, workers' wages can be cut and they won't feel a thing."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:34;19;23;""Work must pay" doesn't mean higher wages. It means continually cutting benefits and reducing entitlement, so that people can still do better than the unemployed, sick and disabled even when their wages are being cut and their employment protection removed."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:31;10;12;"Their proposals for unilateral tariff reduction are integral to their schemes for labour market reform - cutting wages, removing employment protection - and harsher benefit regimes for the poor, unemployed, sick and disabled."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:28;15;21;"But today's right-wingers present the Corn Law repeal as benign worker-friendly legislation. And they promote an equivalent today - unilaterally cutting all tariffs to zero. Beware. Their real agenda is internal devaluation, just as the Anti-Corn Law League's was."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:26;7;9;"Repealing the Corn Laws was thus a critical part of the austerity regime of the mid-19th century. Workers in Great Britain (though not Ireland) did get cheaper bread, but they paid for that in lower wages."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:23;9;19;"I should add that repealing the Corn Laws was disastrous for Ireland's protected agrarian economy - and it coincided with the famine."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:22;5;13;"Repealing the Corn Laws was thus a means of enabling worker wages to be cut, backed up by the threat of the workhouse or starvation."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:20;4;13;"Richard Cobden seems genuinely to have believed in free trade. But he also supported the laissez-faire economics and "work must pay" ideology that caused hardship across the entire UK and especially Ireland, where it contributed to the famine."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:18;6;13;"The Anti-Corn Law League campaigned for repeal of the Corn Laws to reduce the price of bread. Its membership was largely mill owners who wanted to cut wages. What a surprise."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:14;11;20;"The threat of the workhouse enabled industrialists to cut wages. And they did. By 1842, wages had been cut so much that workers could not afford food. There was a general strike to demand restoration of wage cuts."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:11;9;12;"The workhouse test was deliberately harsh to prevent people choosing to enter a workhouse instead of seeking work outside."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:10;12;12;"The backdrop of the Corn Law repeal is the reform of the Poor Law in 1834, which ended outdoor relief (what we would call unemployment benefit) and forced the unemployed, the sick, the disabled, the elderly and children into workhouses."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:09;10;10;"Take the repeal of the Corn Laws, for example. This is presented as a benign decision that greatly benefited UK workers. It was nothing of the kind."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:07;103;124;"I think the most insidious action on the part of those who promote an austerity agenda is the rewriting of history to conceal the awful consequences of previous austerity."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:06;0;1;"I know. I am not assigning blame."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 23:06;75;84;"This. Especially for those who think the "nine freedoms of the air" are some kind of default position, rather than freedoms achieved though negotiation.

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:20;0;0;"Yes, so they have recognised that they need a better command structure and more cooperation between member states regarding deployment of national defence forces. What is wrong with that?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:12;0;0;"Fearing something that doesn't exist is more than slightly bizarre."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:11;0;1;"You clearly do fear an EU version of NATO."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:11;0;0;"I've seldom seen such ridiculous paranoia. You really need to read something more balanced than the Express."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:10;0;0;"National governments of member states of the EU are actually in charge of them. Don't you know ANYTHING? The EU does not have its own forces. Only member states do."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:09;0;0;"Oh ffs. It wasn't "denied", it wasn't even discussed. No-one was considering a pan-EU defence force in 1975. You are being utterly ridiculous."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:08;0;0;"Answer my question. Your stance appears wholly irrational."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:07;0;0;"It was in fact its sole original purpose.https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/history/1945-1959_en …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:06;0;0;"You fear an EU version of NATO, but you don't fear NATO, even though it is dominated by a Trump-led USA. Irrational, much?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:04;0;0;"You seem to be prey to all manner of irrational fears about the EU. It is a very orderly, rule-based organisation, and entirely dependent on cooperation between national governments. There isn't going to be an out-of-control, unaccountable army running amok."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:03;0;0;"Why do you have a problem with the EU creating its own version of NATO? It seems to be what the US wants. If created, it would most likely be modelled on NATO - clear command structure, rules of engagement, national defence forces. Why do you fear this?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 22:00;0;0;"Fact you cite the Express explains why you keep repeating Brexit lies."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:59;0;0;"Right, and that is what the EU does. It was its original purpose."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:57;0;0;"Actually, no he isn't. You are getting what you want. The U.K. is leaving. But no-one shows any signs of agreeing to an EU defence force, or a US of Europe (which would be a prerequisite for a permanent EU army). So he is not getting what he wants."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:54;0;0;"I'm not going to give the Express a click. Find a better source."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:54;0;0;"I genuinely don't know. But I would expect support for USE to be highest in France & Germany. I think support across whole EU28 is probably quite a bit lower."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:51;0;0;"But also, the EU has the objective of fostering peace WITHIN Europe. Preventing another pan-European war. That doesn't need a defence force, it needs close ties and friendship. Trade helps to achieve this, which is why trade was important from the start. It's a means to an end."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:48;0;0;"Cooperation among nation states, obviously. That's how NATO works. It doesn't have its own permanent defence force, it draws on the defence forces of its members."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:46;0;1;"Including Norway is odd, I agree."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:45;0;0;"19 Eurozone states, not 18."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:44;0;0;"I'm not extrapolating. Even in Germany, more people oppose a USE than support it. And in Nordic countries, support is nearly as low as it is in the UK."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:41;0;0;"EU law is no more "foreign law" than the WTO rules the Brexiteers like so much."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:40;0;0;"Describing EU law as "foreign law" which we are "forced to enact" is more Brexiteer lies. We voluntarily joined the EU and agreed to be bound by its treaties."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:36;0;0;"I'm afraid this is nonsense. If we enter into international treaties, we are of course bound by our obligations under those treaties. But as we are party to those treaties, laws arising from them are not "foreign laws"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:34;0;0;"Devaluation is the classic way of defending against the economic damage of a sudden stop, but Bruning did not wish to leave the GS because he feared hyperinflation could return. He preferred austerity to inflation. That's clear from his statements at the time."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:31;0;0;"Yes, I know, that's what I meant by "sudden stop". Sudden pulling of foreign funds forces wrenching closure of trade and fiscal deficits. We see this as combined severe deflation and austerity."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:29;0;0;"Verhofstadt is entitled to his opinion, just as you are. Doesn't mean he gets what he wants. He doesn't dictate policy. You are being silly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:27;0;0;"I'm not going to click on an Express link.. Find a better source."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:26;0;0;"Neither are now in power. Anyway,national politicians can say what they like, but they don't necessarily get it. They have to get the agreement of all the other member states."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:24;0;0;"But even if there were such a plan now (which there isn't), you can hardly expect politicians to foresee that 43 years ago. You're being silly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:22;0;0;"There was never any plan for a permanent pan-EU force. Then, or since."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:21;0;0;"I don't think you can realistically extrapolate to other countries on the basis of support in France and Germany."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:20;0;0;"It's not evenly spread across population, and voting is national. Also, this is only a small proportion of EU states."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:19;0;0;"Yes, and what was said is correct. Parliament has never lost its power. You have been lied to by Brexiteers."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:17;0;0;"As no-one apart from Martin Schulz is seriously proposing political union even now, why the heck would it have been discussed in 1975? You are tilting at windmills."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:15;0;0;"The European rapid defence force is an emergency group formed from national defence forces. It's not in any way an "EU army". And PESCO is a framework for security cooperation between member states. Really, you are being ridiculous."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:10;0;0;"Merkel is calling for an EU army because she is under pressure from Trump to take more responsibility for defence and Germany having its own defence forces raises hackles both inside and outside Germany. It's all about Germany's national interests, not the EU."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:06;0;0;"Excuse me, but we are discussing the 1975 referendum. That is over 40 years ago, not 17. No politician is clairvoyant. I'm amazed how unreasonable you are being."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:04;0;3;"The influence of the extreme right is growing, I agree, but austerity long pre-dates it. Rise of extremist parties (both right and left) is a consequence, not a cause, of austerity."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:03;0;1;"No EU country is currently run by the extreme right, except possibly Poland and Hungary."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:02;0;0;"And please stop complaining that things that are an issue now weren't covered in a 1975 leaflet. Totally unreasonable."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 21:01;0;0;"No it wasn't. Please read that leaflet again. It goes far beyond trade. The EU doesn't have political union even now, but the first objective clearly implies it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:56;0;1;"Oops. My interwar geography isn't that great."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:55;14;32;"Indeed. The research paper I cite in the post issues a stark warning to the EU about repeating the mistakes of the 1930s. I fear the warning will be ignored, just as Keynes's warnings about the folly of reparations and austerity were ignored."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:53;0;0;"The EU approach to defence has always been cooperation between member states, not a pan-European army. The ultras have proposed this, but none of the member states want it - and it is their votes that matter."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:51;0;0;"No it isn't. Please stop this scaremongering."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:51;0;0;"You can't appeal to Versailles, sorry. French occupied Ruhr (and A-L) because they thought Germany was breaking the Versailles terms."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:49;0;0;"I don't think I was a small minority."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:48;0;0;"Oh yes. Indeed there was a boom in 2013, which burst dramatically in 2014 when Mt.Gox went down."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:47;0;0;"Food, jobs and money were specifically discussed in the leaflet because those were the areas that Wilson had renegotiated. Nowhere does the leaflet say the sole objective of the EEC was trade."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:45;0;0;"It is one of the five objectives of the EEC as laid out in the Government's leaflet. It has exactly the same prominence as trade."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:43;0;0;"But anyway, the objectives of the Treaty of Rome were laid out in the Government's referendum leaflet."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:42;0;0;"Well I managed to read it, and I was at school."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:40;0;0;"Peace is a clearly stated objective in the UK Government's leaflet."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:35;0;0;"No"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:34;0;0;"You could have looked up the Treaty of Rome n the library. And the discussion certainly wasn't all about trade. Much of it was about peace."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:33;0;0;"Under *no* obligation to join."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:33;0;0;"And from which the UK secured a permanent opt-out regarding monetary union."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:32;0;0;"What utter tosh. Wilson obtained an opt-put from the ERM. We did not have to join. And we have a permanent opt-out from the Euro too. We were under obligation to join."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:30;0;3;"I think it's all about hope. When you destroy hope, you destroy life."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:29;0;0;"Note "confirm their commitment to ever-closer union". It was already an objective. Had been from the start."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:28;0;0;"Those are necessary for the objectives to be met. They are a means, not an end. You were NOT lied to. You didn't understand."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:27;0;0;"Ok, five. Of which ONLY ONE is about trade. And the first is about closer union."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:26;0;0;"Alsace-Lorraine until 1930, Saar until 1935."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:25;0;0;"And the very long document you previously linked is dated 1971. That is before the UK joined the EEC. The terms were subsequently renegotiated, so the document was obsolete by 1974 when the referendum was announced."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:23;0;0;"Rubbish. The leaflet distributed to ordinary ppl in 1975 is extremely clear. It was not solely about trade - indeed most of the leaflet isn't concerned with trade. You weren't paying attention."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:21;0;0;"And the leaflet also clearly states that there was a movement towards monetary union from which Wilson had secured an opt-out. He also obtained a budget rebate."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:18;0;0;"The leaflet clearly states the objectives of the European Community as laid out in the Treaty of Rome. Trade is only one of six."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:16;0;0;"Not true. Aim of ever-closer union goes back to 1957. Clause 1 of the preamble to the Treaty of Rome. https://ec.europa.eu/romania/sites/romania/files/tratatul_de_la_roma.pdf …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:06;0;0;"Show me an example of an untried alternative being better."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:04;0;3;"When you are stuck, you have no hope. The unknown is not "safe", but it offers hope. That was Keynes's insight in 1932. I quoted him in the post."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 20:02;0;2;"Also the Ruhr was occupied by France from 1923 until the 1930s."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:59;0;1;"Did the Ruhr show increased support for Communism? Might expect that, given that was the industrial region. Unemployment among industrial workers exceeded 43% in 1932."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:57;1;3;"Just as support for Brexit was low in London and prosperous industrial areas."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:56;0;0;"Interesting."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:50;1;9;"Yes! And that is what Keynes warned in 1932. People in Germany wanted a "change". They didn't know what, just not the status quo."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:29;130;236;"Can I point out, for those who question the role of austerity in bringing Hitler to power, that the unemployed were turning to Communism as the middle classes were turning to Nazism. Austerity drove people to extremist parties. That's the point."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:16;0;7;"When are you going to talk to people who don't agree with # WASPI? For balance, you know? It's not your job to shill for WASPI. You're a journalist. You should be neutral.https://twitter.com/savvy_woman/status/946695052012740608 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:11;0;2;"many of the U.K. govt decisions at the time, such as the decision not to stop exports, have been heavily criticised since. But the economic evidence suggests that famine was inevitable whatever the policies. It had been set up decades before."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:06;0;3;"It's interesting reading narrative accounts of terrible political tragedies. I recently read Kelly's The graves are walking" about the Irish famine. There's a sense of inevitability running through it. Can't pinpoint one single event or decision and say "that's what caused it"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 19:00;0;1;"Also true in Italy. Corporatism was an important part of Fascism."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:58;0;1;"Also, IMHO combined fiscal austerity and monetary tightness is not a sufficient explanation for Hitler's rise. Geddes Axe in early 1920s UK was a brutal consolidation combined with high interest rates, but didn't result in a fascist govt."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:55;0;0;"That said, the researchers I cited concluded that the austerity was excessive and driven by political motivation. Bruning's aim was to get reparations cancelled due to extreme hardship among Germans. Keynes was pretty horrified."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:52;0;0;"He wasn't dealing with a sudden stop."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:36;0;0;"Also, Bruning may have had little choice. Germany had a "sudden stop" in 1931 when Creditanstahlt failed. He would have been forced either to impose austerity to close the trade and fiscal deficits, or leave the GS less than 10 years after hyperinflation."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:28;0;0;"Hah, there's a thought!"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:26;0;0;"In the research paper there is an implication (which they don't explore) that the rise of the Nazi party was in part driven by fear of Communism."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:24;0;2;"I read something along those lines from Isaiah Berlin recently. Was going to write about it. Definitely applies to Brexit voters IMHO."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:22;0;3;"I think it probably fair to say that austerity didn't cause fascism - that has much longer and deeper roots - but it did amplify it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:20;1;0;"Oh yes, there are undoubtedly other drivers too. I said that in the post."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:05;0;4;"What I find interesting is that the turn to nationalism occurred not among the very poor, but among those who "still had something to lose", as the researchers put it. People whose wealth is threatened close ranks to protect it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 18:00;0;0;"Apparently so, yes. But popular mythology is hard to shift."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-29 17:42;6;13;"Oh but that's different. Only the poor must work. Idleness among the rich is virtuous. Encourages philanthropy and public service."

I can campaign for Parliament to overturn the decision. That is how our system works."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:44;20;61;"I have every right to use peaceful debate and campaigning to try to overturn a democratic decision with which I disagree. And I have every right to do this for as long as I think it is necessary. You are using ad hominem arguments to deny my democratic rights.https://twitter.com/JonRIvins/status/946010029811027968 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:39;0;0;"June 2017 passed you by, then???"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:39;0;0;"Hah, good point."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:38;0;0;"And if they are doing it in secret, how do you know about it, anyway. You really shouldn't believe what you read in the tabloids, you know. They make stuff up."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:35;0;0;"You do not have the right to use toxic hate-filled language about people who don't agree with you."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:34;0;0;"Of course you will immediately start campaigning for a different result at the next election. That's what political parties do. You will also try to influence the direction of Parliamentary decisions. That's what the Opposition does. You don't seem to understand our system."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:31;0;0;"In other words, our system allows people to change their minds. It also permits peaceful campaigning to persuade people to change their minds. You want to deny people both of these rights. That is fundamentally undemocratic."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:28;0;0;"We have perpetual GEs. It is how our system works. If we don't like the decisions of our elected representatives, we kick them out and elect people who will change the decisions. We don't have immutable decisions in our system. We CAN change the Brexit decision."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:24;0;0;"Describing people as "saboteurs" is inciting hatred."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:24;8;26;"I think Brexit is destructive, and I want it stopped, or at least substantially softened. There is nothing "loaded" or "toxic" about this. It is simply my opinion, which I have the democratic right to hold and express, and to act upon by peaceful means."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:18;0;0;"I haven't used hate-filled, toxic and emotionally loaded terms about anyone. I've merely pointed out how fundamentally undemocratic your stance is. Oh and "tu quoque" is a fallacious argument. Address the points I make."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:15;0;0;"Don't mess with the Balkans."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:14;0;0;"No, it isn't. Discussing campaigning tactics is not "sabotage"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:12;0;0;"And you do have a problem with opposing views. You don't mind people disagreeing with the result, but you object to them doing anything to change it. That's like saying you can be a Catholic as long as you attend Anglican Church services instead of going to Mass."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:09;0;0;"He was. He's in his sixties, and anyone who is now in their sixties or older was eligible to vote in the 1975 ref."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:07;0;1;"Quite possibly, but that doesn't mean Paul Dacre sees them as his core readership."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:06;0;0;"No there isn't. Only in your imagination."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:05;0;0;"Overturning a democratic decision by peaceful democratic means - campaigning, persuasion - is not sabotage. You have no right whatsoever to use such hate-filled, toxic language against those who are exercising their democratic right to try to overturn a democratic decision."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:02;0;0;"They do not have to respect the result and they do not have to "allow it to be implemented". They have every right to try to overturn the result by peaceful means. Your language is hate-filled and toxic."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 21:01;0;0;"Also worth remembering that at times it went far beyond discrimination and barring from public office. Persecution and violence against Catholics was a recurrent feature of British politics."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:56;0;0;"But you have. You deny people their right to try to get the decision changed NOW."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:55;0;0;"Yes you have. You said they must accept the result and refrain from campaigning to change it. That is not Western democracy."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:53;0;12;"Your language is loaded, toxic and hate-filled. It is a fine example of the divisiveness I was talking about."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:49;0;1;"No, they are campaigning to change the outcome. That is their democratic right. It is not in any way "sabotage" to campaign to change the outcome."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:48;0;0;"No they didn't. Hardcore Brexiters like Bernard Jenkin never accepted the result. They started campaigning immediately."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:47;0;1;"The tabloids are not a "Twitter bubble". They persistently spew out hatred towards Remainers."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:45;0;0;"Totally oppose another ref. I think Parliament should decide, on a free vote. Parliament is sovereign. Let it exercise its sovereignty in this matter."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:44;0;0;"But you ARE disputing it. You are calling a Remain minority "saboteurs" for exercising ther democratic right to campaign to change a decision of the majority."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:42;0;2;"Yes, it is. Worth remembering too that Northern Irish sectarianism is a relic of UK-wide sectarianism that lasted for well over 300 years. The last of the institutional restrictions on Catholics were only removed in the 1990s. Divides do not heal easily or quickly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:39;0;0;"You have no right to define ANY time period, reasonable or otherwise."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:38;0;0;"Your position amounts to "they have the democratic right to do as I say". That's the democracy of North Korea. Every one-party state in the world calls itself "democratic". But it's not Western democracy."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:35;0;7;"Yes you have. You want them to lose their democratic right to campaign to change the outcome. You call them "saboteurs" for campaigning to change it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:34;0;0;"Yes you are. You say it was fine for those who opposed the 1975 decision to campaign to change it, but those who oppose the 2016 decision should just "accept it". That is special pleading."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:32;0;1;"Tabloids decided that those who voted Remain weren't their core market."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:32;0;1;"Yes they have. Persistently and continually, ever since the vote."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:31;0;0;"Your experience is not universal. Generalising from the particular is fallacious argument."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:30;0;0;"You don't have the right to set a timespan."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:29;0;0;"Minorities have the right to campaign to change decisions of the majority. That is not "tyranny", it is the necessary democratic means of preventing tyranny."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:28;0;8;"So? That doesn't mean that those who disagree with the outcome of this vote should lose their democratic right to campaign for something else. Seems you only want democracy when it suits you."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:26;0;0;"They are entitled to campaign to change the outcome, for decades on end if they want. That is democracy. True for Remainers now just as it was for Brexiters in 1975. Stop the special pleading."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:24;0;0;"Rubbish."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:24;0;0;"Just as people who opposed the result of the 1975 referendum had the right to campaign to change the outcome, so too do people who oppose the result of the 2016 referendum."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:22;0;0;"No. We do not have to accept the outcome. We can campaign to change it. If we can't, then we do not have democracy, we have tyranny of the majority."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:21;0;8;"And it was not "the largest plebiscite we have ever had". 1975 referendum as as big. And those who disagreed with that result immediately started campaigning to overturn it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:19;0;0;"They are entitled to express their opinion, and to campaign for a different outcome. That is DEMOCRACY. It is not treason or sabotage to campaign to overturn a decision they think is wrong."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:17;1;3;"1) Yes. Both sides became abusive in the # indyref. Poisonous. 2) Britain is nothing like Switzerland. Our system of parliamentary democracy is entirely different. Our equivalent of Swiss referendum is Parliamentary petition."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:15;0;4;"Half the population is now routinely abused by the tabloid press. I'm not saying abusing minorities is ok, but I have never, ever seen such divisiveness in my life."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:13;0;1;"The referendum hasn't "lanced" anything. It has created a deep infected wound which will take a very long time to heal."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:12;0;5;"It doesn't help when people are called "traitors" and "saboteurs" for voicing their opinion, either. The nastiness is on BOTH SIDES."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:11;0;0;"That's what Parliament is for. The referendum undermined Parliament - bound it in a way no government can. No more referenda. Ever. They are toxic in our system."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:09;0;2;"Media generally, not just Twitter. Look at what the tabloids say about those who voted to Remain."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:06;0;1;"YES!"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:06;0;0;"Not convinced. There wasn't such widespread depersonalisation before. "Othering" existed, of course, but it affected minorities, not half the population."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 20:02;10;39;"These two tweets demonstrate the terrible damage that Brexit is doing to the fabric of British society. To each side, the other is now "them".

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 19:08;0;3;"Yes, and Kowloon. There was some debate at the time about whether Britain could negotiate keeping HK and having some kind of "special arrangement" regarding New Territories and Kowloon, but it was always unworkable."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 09:37;0;0;"I don't disagree, but equally you are not seeing the implied racism in classifying "most" white Christians as fake purely because of their skin colour. American & Australian "evangelicals" are a minority of white Christians worldwide. Not a majority."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 09:33;0;2;"And remember that there was systematic oppression of Catholics in Northern Ireland within living memory. Also in some places in Scotland, too."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-27 09:32;0;2;"Because in our day, oppressive regimes have black or Asian populations, you assume that has always been the case. It is not true. Ask the Irish about oppression of white Christians."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-24 12:51;0;0;"Worth remembering that the original aim was to bind European countries so tightly together that there would never be another destructive war. Trade was a means to an end, not an end in itself."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-24 12:43;0;1;"It's worth reading the early statutes, you know. What the EU is now was clearly prefigured then, apart from the inclusion of Iron Curtain states - which Britain was instrumental in bringing about."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-24 12:41;0;0;"I'm afraid that is not true. Deeper union was envisaged by the original six states, long before Britain joined. Indeed that is why De Gaulle did not want Britain to join."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-24 12:08;11;35;"Brexiters have constantly told Brits that that they can continue to have freedom of movement while denying it to EU citizens. I think they believe this themselves. But it is not, and never has been, true."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-24 12:00;32;40;"It could hardly be clearer. Travelling to and between EU countries will be more difficult for Brits after Brexit. By the sound of it, it will be like going to the US. Bureaucratic and time-consuming for everyone, and for a small minority, impossible."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 17:30;0;2;"State pension is a contributory benefit for which you become eligible when you reach state pension age.

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:24;0;0;"I don't really care, frankly. I'm fed up with your sob stories. The truth is you couldn't be arsed to find out about the state pension age rises. Why should the rest of us, who did find out despite busy and demanding lives, bail you out?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:21;1;1;"It is how legislation works. You weren't written to about banning using mobile phones while driving, either - but if you are caught using one, magistrates are not going to accept "I never got a letter" as an excuse. Ignorance of the law is no defence."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:17;0;0;"No, they weren't in 1995. The reason for the equalisation at 65 was because the future cost of pensions would bankrupt the NI Fund. Read the Budget speech I sent you."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:15;0;1;"No doubt, but it was still your responsibility to find out. I know this sounds harsh, but it is how legislation works. Government does not notify personally."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:14;0;0;"It is your duty as citizen to find out about legislation that affects you. Your letters about DLA were not about legislation, they were about your personal claim. Totally different."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:12;0;0;"The £31 bn are statutory reserves. The Government has in fact topped them up by £14,6bn in the last 2 years. They are needed to cover variations in income and outgoings - like reserves in a bank. They are not available for 1950s women's pensions."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:07;0;0;"And in my view, those women would not have taken any notice of an unsolicited letter sent 15 years or more before their 60th birthday, either."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:04;0;1;"Don't be so bloody arrogant. Plenty of women did find out, including women who were working very hard and had extensive caring responsibilities and health problems. If women didn't bother to find out, it was because it wasn't important to them."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:03;0;0;"Oh, another ridiculous assertion. Nothing has been "stolen". All that has happened is that Parliament has changed the eligibility criteria for a state benefit, as it is legally entitled to do. Btw it is not legally required to give any notice or to notify personally."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 10:01;0;0;"Yep, it's absolutely enough. You wouldn't have read a letter anyway."

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 09:59;0;0;"Absolutely. I don't want any special treatment for 1950s women. I want a working age benefits system that is suitable for people approaching retirement and less harsh towards everyone."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 09:58;0;0;"He didn't. That was George Osborne, speaking about the 2011 Act. Do you EVER bother to check facts before making assertions?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 09:56;0;0;"Oh, and the "you must have money" accusation is just plain ridiculous. I would have to pay for 1950s women's early pensions. I don't have money to spare for that, I'm afraid."
Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 09:56;0;0;"If 1950s women couldn't be arsed to watch the Budget broadcast live on TV or any of the prime time TV news reports, or listen to radio news, or read newspapers, why would they bother to read a spam letter about a pension that was well over 15 years away?"

Frances_Coppola;2017-12-13 09:42;1;1;"Nonsense. The decision to equalise state pension ages at 65 was on prime time TV and radio, and on the front pages of newspapers. Hardly an effective way of concealing it from the women affected, is it?"

Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 11:03;0;0;"Ooh cool. I enjoyed our discussion too! Thanks. And good night."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 11:03;0;0;"But as I've already pointed out, when the crypto bubble bursts, all sorts of things will be bailed out. Possibly including banks, though most banks seem to be saying "no thanks" to crypto trading."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 11:02;0;0;"Some will, yes."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 11:01;0;1;"It needs to have fully secure transaction accounts. Imho transactional money should not be placed at risk. But savings need to be placed at risk in order to generate a return. I wish ppl understood this."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:59;0;0;"They don't have the power to bring down the economy. Yet you think it's ok for them to lose their jobs, but not for GM workers. Seems to me it is GM workers that have the lobbying power."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:58;0;0;"Yes it did. And I'm sorry, but the thousands of people who do ordinary jobs in ordinary banks for ordinary money DO matter."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:56;0;0;"They aren't that bad now. I look at bank financial statements professionally. Far more transparent than they used to be, though still room for improvement."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:55;0;0;"Credit unions are more risky, not less. Individually they fail extraordinarily frequently. They just don't do much damage when they fail, because they are small and not very interconnected."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:54;0;0;"No bank ever has just deposits on its balance sheet. Even a full reserve bank would have deposits on the liability side and cash reserves (or other highly liquid safe assets) on the asset side."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:53;0;0;"Mortgages. Btw you are confusing the two sides of the balance sheet. Deposits are liabilities. Loans and purchased securities are assets."

Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:49;0;0;"You may not, but others will - like the thousands of ordinary people whose retirement savings are being put at risk."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:48;0;0;"Banks can become insolvent in a crisis even if they have not taken excessive risks. Asset price collapse causes well-managed banks to become insolvent."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:47;0;0;"Anyway, it is 2.47 am here in the UK and I must go to bed! Goodnight. Thanks for the discussion."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:46;0;0;"It is not verifiable by the vast majority of the public, even though they read English and did maths at school."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:45;0;0;"But you don't think financial institutions can rebound and become more efficient after a bailout? Why not?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:45;0;0;"And the thousands of people employed in the financial industry don't matter? Really?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:44;0;0;"There is also stuff about leverage and feedback loops that I won't bore you with, but that is really solved by much higher capital requirements."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:43;0;1;"Indeed. But we need financial institutions to be interconnected, or the financial system doesn't work. The problem is the trade-off between liquidity (interconnectedness) and safety."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:42;0;0;"Imho what we should be doing is separating the money that people can't afford to lose access to (transaction accounts) from money that they can afford to tie up (savings accounts)."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:40;0;1;"Right. And retail banks do that just as much as investment banks. Retail banking is inherently risky. Worth remembering that every one of the British banks that failed in 2007-8 was a retail bank."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:38;0;0;"But your money will bail them out. Because it is your money, and the money of millions of others, that is being invested in the cryptocurrency bubble."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:37;0;0;"No, that wasn't the problem it was trying to solve."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:37;0;0;"Banks have always used deposits to fund lending. Always. We can discuss what sort of lending they should be funding, but it is sheer nonsense to talk of "holding" money placed on deposit."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:35;0;0;"Banks have never "held" money placed on deposit. Never in the whole history of banking. Retail banks don't "hold" money. Never have."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:34;0;0;"Law is in English, but still requires specialist skills to understand it. Advanced mathematics is understood by only a small percentage of the population, but is essential in much science. If you can't do the maths (and most ppl can't) you can't understand the science."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:31;0;0;"General Motors was bailed out in the crisis - and I don't mean GMAC, I mean the car manufacturer itself. Moral hazard, much?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:28;0;0;"Lehman was not a retail bank. AIG was an insurance company. Reserve Primary was a mutual fund. RBS was a British universal bank, yes, but it was brought down by its acquisition of ABN AMRO. Lloyds/HBOS did not have an investment banking arm."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:27;0;0;"Institutional separation of retail and investment banks would not have prevented the fall of Lehman or the ensuing bailouts."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:26;0;0;"You are obsessed with bailouts. Yet you appear strangely unmoved by the growing evidence that TBTF institutional investors are piling into a cryptocurrency bubble that is bound to burst."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:25;0;0;"You don't construct modern code the way you construct a COBOL program. Equally, you don't regulate modern banks the way you regulated the banks of the 1930s. Learn from history rather than blindly tring to re-create it. What problem did Glass-Steagall try to solve?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:23;0;0;"All human societies have division of labour and specialisation. Why should your system be different?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:22;0;0;"Banking changed fundamentally in the 1970s and 80s. The distinction between "investment" and "retail" banking is very blurred now. Imho we need to look at how banking works now, not try to reinstate legislation from a bygone age."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:20;0;0;"I don't think reinstating that separation would be remotely helpful. We are not in the 1930s now."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:18;0;0;"I am discussing the financial system, not banks and their profits."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:17;0;0;"Why should it? Why shouldn't it invest in a few people, so they become experts, and then rely on them to translate for everyone else? Much cheaper that way."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:16;0;0;"Again, you seem to want the state to do things, but then you object to the consequences of the state doing them. In a regulated market, there are limits to people's freedom to do and say what they like. You don't like that."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:14;0;0;"What is the difference between regulation and censorship? How can a market be regulated without limiting people's rights - for example, their right to rip someone off if they can get away with it? (that's "caveat emptor")"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:12;0;0;"Why shouldn't it? Who are you to decide what the state should and shouldn't do? If people democratically decide that some people shouldn't have rights, and some financial institutions should be bailed out, what right do you have to prevent that?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:11;0;0;"Also irrelevant."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:10;0;0;"Cryptocurrencies are simply piggybacking off the cashless system."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:10;0;0;"Let me put it another way. The fundamental change from a cash-based society to a largely cashless one happened in the 1970s & 80s. It was not completed then, but that was when the really important changes were made."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:08;0;0;"Irrelevant. Traders are not crucial to the financial system and never were."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:07;0;0;"Don't talk down to me. The core of the financial system was effectively fully automated in the 1980s. I was there."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:06;0;0;"Seems to me you want to have your cake and eat it. You don't want the state, but you want the state to do things that benefit your industry."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:04;0;0;"But you want to disintermediate the state. Or dismantle it. Hardly compatible with demanding that the state provide free financial education - or teach everyone to code, for that matter - is it?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:03;0;0;"Computers are not more important to the financial system now than they were then."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:01;0;0;"Rubbish. By the 1980s, the financial system was completely dependent on computers. Customers didn't yet use them, but the business did."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 10:00;0;1;"It's a lovely dream, this idea of a totally open system that anyone can understand, but I really don't think it will ever happen. Reality is that power will be held by those who do understand, who will "translate" for those who don't."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:58;0;0;"The vast majority of people never learn now to invest in stock. They rely upon fund managers to make decisions for them."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:58;0;0;"It won't remove that hazard. In fact when the cryptocurrency bubble bursts, I think the state may be called upon to bail out institutional investors who have bought in."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:55;0;0;"I gave you the COBOL example. People did not learn to read code then, when the code was in English. Why would they now, when it isn't?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:54;0;0;"Umm. The DAO investors were totally naive."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:52;0;0;"I don't think people who aren't coders understand that code is idiosyncratic."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:52;0;1;"We were doing RPG, which is not in English and one of the most complicated programming languages ever devised, so coding standards were essential. Without them, devs could not understand each other's work."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:50;0;0;"The coding standards we put in place when I was at Midland Bank were democratically determined by the coders themselves."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:49;0;0;"Why should the state step up, if the aim of the cryptocurrency movement is to disintermediate the state?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:49;0;0;"If you want power to be in the hands of the public, the public must understand. Simply making code they can't read available to them is not giving them power."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:47;0;0;"No coding standards, no documentation, poor structuring (hence the data integrity breach), poor code reviews, inadequate testing - honestly, it was utterly unprofessional. And to crown it all, they then enticed people to invest in this lump of bad code."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:45;1;2;"And good coders. I was appalled by the cavalier attitude of those devs. They had effectively thrown away all the good practices we - an older generation of fintech coders - put in place in the 1980s."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:42;0;0;"Indeed. That is my point."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:39;14;6;"The mysterious case of the two John Redwoodshttp://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/the-mysterious-case-of-the-two-john-redwoods-1-5292692?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social_Icon&utm_campaign=in_article_social_icons …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:36;0;0;"But if you can't read code, then you don't know what is going on. And remember what I said about COBOL. That was in English, and yet people still couldn't read it well enough to know what it was doing."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:35;0;0;"It's still limited to people who can read code, though. That's the point. I can, but then I was a coder for a long time. One language is much like another, really."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:33;0;0;"Where is the translation into the common language? Where is the mass education?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:32;1;1;"So you support a campaign that would make women even less equal?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:31;0;0;"Yes. And that is what your devs are NOT doing."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:30;0;0;"Arguably, no. Not until the advent of universal education."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:29;0;0;"Law is effectively not in the public domain, since understanding it requires technical expertise."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:28;0;0;"While devs continue to believe that open-source code alone is sufficient for power to be widely dispersed, power will remain in very few hands."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:26;0;1;"I looked at the DAO code. It's not my language, but I could see the problem. Didn't maintain data integrity in subroutines. It wouldn't have passed any code review I was doing. Yet the problem was missed by devs who knew the language."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:25;0;0;"You will never, ever have a wholly code-literate population. Even many devs can't read code fluently. The DAO code had undergone code reviews, but the error that enabled the hack was missed."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:23;0;0;"Putting code in the public domain has the same problem. Ordinary people can't read code, so even though they can look at it, they need a tech-savvy elite to translate it for them. That elite can tell them anything they like. People won't know if they are being fooled."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:22;0;2;"Those monks and priests could teach ordinary people anything they liked, and ordinary people would have no way of knowing whether what they taught was actually in the Bible."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:21;0;1;"To give an analogy: in the Dark Ages, the Bible was in Latin. Ordinary people didn't understand Latin. So they couldn't read the Bible. Access to what it said was controlled by a tech-savvy elite - monks and priests who learned Latin."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:18;0;0;"I repeat, if the public does not understand the material in the public domain, it is effectively not in the public domain."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:17;1;1;"If you need intermediaries to translate, then you immediately introduce principal-agent problems - which you said you were trying to eliminate."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:16;0;0;"Mpesa is run by a multinational corporation that isn't accountable to anybody. And it fundamentally depends on access to sovereign currency. Brilliant for a developing country where far more ppl have smartphones than access to banks. Won't take off in developed countries."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:13;0;0;"Not all lending is against collateral. Look it would help if you understood the existing system.....unsecured lending is more common than you think. The higher risk is compensated by higher interest rates."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:11;0;0;"But ordinary people can't read it, even though it is in English. Can you read an undocumented COBOL program well enough to understand what it is doing? I can, but then I was a COBOL programmer, a long time ago."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:10;0;0;"Back in the 1970s, the programming language COBOL was intended to be comprehensible by ordinary people. It is in English, unlike modern code. So developers didn't document what they were doing, because they thought anyone could read it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:08;1;1;"The language of the code - and the language of the devs themselves, since they use immense amounts of jargon and hash-speak - shuts out ordinary folk. "Public" it may be, but if the public don't understand, it might as well be private."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:05;0;1;"Part of the naivety of the crypto movement is its belief that open source is sufficient for protocol to be public. It is not. Most people can't read code well enough to understand what is going on. And devs don't document their code. Believe me, I've looked."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:03;0;1;"When there is no censorship at all, "free speech" for some denies free speech to others. An unregulated market is a jungle."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:02;0;0;"That is simply not true, and a dangerously naive belief. Twitter and Facebook have both now introduced censorship because they became dangerous to peaceful users. I have been at the centre of a tweetstorm. I received death threats."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 09:00;0;0;"You do not know what "my shoes" are. You seem to assume I am ignorant of the technology and naive about its use. I am neither."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:59;0;0;"And how exactly does a cryptocurrency system in which lending is almost non-existent solve those problems?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:57;0;1;"I would regard the Ethereum Foundation's behaviour over the DAO hacking as censorship. People were not told the truth."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:56;0;1;"Any organisation can control what its members or affiliates see or hear. Doesn't have to be the state. So, the Ethereum Foundation can control what Ethereum users see or hear in order to manipulate their behaviour - and it did so, when repairing the DAO hack."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:54;0;0;"That is not the definition of censorship.https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/censorship …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:52;0;1;"I keep hearing "what about all the people excluded from financial services" from crypto enthusiasts, but when I prod, they mainly seem to talk about people who want to transact on the dark web and are prevented from doing so by KYC/AML rules."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:50;0;0;"The current model in fact provides efficient, low-cost financial services to the vast majority of people in developed countries. Different in developing countries, of course."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:47;0;0;"The question is what the limits of censorship should be ("who censors the censors"), and what the limits of secrecy should be."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:46;0;0;"I don't regard permissionless, open networks as necessarily a good thing. And censorship is necessary in a civilised society."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:45;0;0;"Many times, Jack! I am a notorious sceptic."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:42;0;0;"I really don't need an explainer."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:42;0;3;"That's nicely obscure."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:42;0;0;"Both."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:41;0;1;"I think the current wave of cryptocurrencies are the equivalent of Betamax and VHS. Some will win, temporarily, but eventually they will be superseded by something much better."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:40;0;0;"It completely fails on both of those."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:39;0;0;"yes they can. And privately owned databases are a good thing. I don't want the entire world seeing my financial transactions, thank you."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:38;0;1;"the difference between existing payments technology and cryptocurrencies isn't anywhere near as great as that between paper and the Internet. That Rubicon was crossed for financial transactions in the 1980s."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:36;0;1;"payments are not done with dusty ledgers and quill pens, you know. They aren't paper-based. And except for international payments, they aren't slow or expensive."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:35;0;0;"yes, but that is an entirely false comparison. You don't seem to know much about existing payment technology."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:33;0;1;"I think it is actually hyperinflation, though. Tulip bulbs have some intrinsic value, since they can produce flowers. Cryptocurrencies are intrinsically valueless, just as fiat currencies are. Adding bells and whistles doesn't make them any more valuable."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:30;0;1;"me too. The higher it goes, the worse the collapse will be."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:29;0;0;"I have yet to see any evidence that it is a significant improvement from a use point of view. It does soothe the fears of those who think government is out to get them, though."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:26;0;0;"I am planning to. This will be such fun."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:23;0;0;"lol. I deeply sympathise."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:20;0;0;"certainly looks like that."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:19;0;1;"it isn't, except for true believers. But if you are a true believer you won't listen to anything I say, so I'm not going to try to convince you."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-26 08:18;0;1;"calling the top is very difficult. I called it much too early, back in July. Didn't expect institutional investors to join in the feeding frenzy. Still think it will burst, but when is anyone's guess."

Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:39;0;0;"Fair. Though I wonder if employers are guilty of gold plating skills needs in order to outsource training to the public sector as much as possible (and blame the public sector for shortfalls)"

Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:21;0;1;"Yes, there needs to be some way of ensuring employers get the benefit from the training they provide."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:19;0;3;"I'm complaining about moaning in general, not moaning by individual employers. Biggest moaners are industry bodies such as the CBI."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:17;0;1;"Yes. Like the famous civil service trade-off: lower pay relative to similar private sector jobs, but security of employment and a very good pension."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:16;0;0;"we were discussing that on another thread. For some workforces, price might be less important than terms & conditions."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:15;0;0;"I agree price isn't everything."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:15;1;3;"yes, this is my argument. If employers won't train, then labour must underwrite its own training. This will raise the market clearing price of labour."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:12;0;1;"typo. Easily done."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:12;2;4;"Ah that makes far more sense! Yes, I agree. Employers in the UK moan about "skills shortages" when what they mean is "can't get the staff at the price I want to pay"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:11;0;0;"with nurses the enticement might be better/more flexible working conditions rather than higher pay, since the workforce is predominantly female - women often incentivised more by quality of life than pay"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:05;0;2;"unwillingness by EMPLOYEES to "be reasonable"? Do you mean accept lower wages? Why should they? Why shouldn't employers pay the wage at which the market will clear?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:02;0;3;"Yes. There is considerable evidence that young people now change jobs much less than previous generations at their age."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 07:00;0;1;"It depends on the age. Young people are pretty mobile. Older people much less so. Home ownership restricts mobility. So do caring responsibilities - children, elderly relatives. Social ties can too."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:59;0;0;"I'm amazed. You seem to think that people train in response to existing opportunities. They don't. They train in response to FUTURE opportunities. Employers must forecast."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:57;0;0;"Employers should forecast their needs well in advance so that training providers can plan. Then there will be much better information on opportunities."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:56;0;0;"but those skills shortages should normally be transient, as I said. Persistent shortages of particular skills indicate market failure."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:54;0;0;"In fact I would say skills shortages are necessary for a well-functioning labour market. We do not want there to be a surplus of skilled labour. It pushes down wages at all levels including unskilled, and causes unemployment at the lowest levels."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:52;0;0;"There is no such thing as a skills shortage in the medium-term. There may be short-term shortfalls that drive up the price of skilled labour. Higher price encourages ppl to develop those skills, and it also drives poorer (or meaner) employers out of the market."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:49;11;18;"Employers can always find staff if they are willing to pay well. Especially if labour is mobile. Seriously, this "skills shortage" stuff is the lump of labour fallacy.https://twitter.com/eschizas/status/933820014578339846 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:47;2;0;"Yes exactly. I am however sick of employers moaning about skills shortfalls while making little attempt to forecast their needs accurate or underwrite training programmes."
Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:45;1;1;"What a ridiculous statement. Skills shortfalls cannot be closed by waving a magic wand. Skills development takes time. Needs must be accurately forecast years in advance if supply shortfalls are to be avoided."

Frances_Coppola;2017-11-24 06:35;0;1;"This inflation is caused by sterling depreciation not wage pressure. If the output gap were close to closure, we would expect to see higher wage demands in response to inflation, as in the early 1970s. We don't see that. Ergo, it is not close to closure."

Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 02:09;0;0;""Free trade" when you are price maker is fundamentally different from "free trade" when you are price taker."

Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 02:07;0;0;"Yep, my view too. In which case Corn Laws repeal totally inapplicable to current situation. Effects completely different."
Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 02:06;0;0;"however, the real issue is that the situation then was VERY different from now. Corn Laws nothing whatsoever like EU tariffs."
Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:53;0;0;"I am sceptical that the effects were as beneficial as the "free traders" say. Think it is more nuanced."
Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:52;0;0;"other redistribution is the better course, surely, if overall income is increased by tariffs as Williamson says? Taxes, not tariffs."

Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:46;0;0;"also, the Corn Laws were a distortionary tariff on one sector only - grain production - which was not even dominant in agriculture."
Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:44;0;0;"under the Corn Laws, Britain was arguably price maker (bcs dominant imperial power at that time). If price taker now, effect not comparable."
Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:43;0;1;"benefits mostly flowing to landowners is a domestic distributional effect, of course."
Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:39;0;1;"Williamson says tax mainly fell on foreigners bcs of terms of trade effects. Overall, therefore, that is a domestic benefit."

Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:34;0;0;"and that under any scenario, the real impact of Corn Law repeal was distributional."
Frances_Coppola;2017-10-10 01:32;0;0;"Paper I was reading says that if UK was price maker (not unreasonable as imperial power at that time), Corn Laws overall improved welfare."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:57;0;0;"If you haven't read any of those reports, then you are a windbag. You know nothing and have nothing credible or important to say."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:55;0;0;"Again, this is not a "Tory view", it is research evidence. Now, answer my question. Have you read the reports I cited?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:54;0;0;"it's your repeated accusations that are like Robot May. Or perhaps more like a Dalek. "You Are A Tory....EXTERMINATE""
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:52;0;0;"And have you read any of Henry George's work?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:52;0;0;"Now I've answered your question. Time for you to answer mine. Which of the reports I have cited have you read?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:51;0;0;"Most women affected by the changes were aware of them. There is a minority that did not know."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:48;0;0;"Which question was that? I've answered lots of your questions. Or rather, the same question repeated multiple times."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:46;0;0;"Oh give it a rest, for goodness sake, and answer my question. Have you read the reports I cite?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:45;0;0;"yeah, I need to call a halt, really."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:44;0;0;"I expect YOU, as a pensions professional, to know that legislation is its own notification."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:43;0;0;"I made no judgement, simply a statement of fact."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:42;0;1;"I am asking what research you have done into the state pension issue. I have read all these reports. Have you?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:41;0;0;"If you don't know that legislation is its own notification, you are in serious danger of giving people wrong advice."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:40;0;0;"I did not say they did. But legislation is its own notification. I would expect a pensions professional to know that."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:39;0;1;"Think you are dead right. He's been on the sauce."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:38;0;1;"Again, simply a statement of fact.https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886036413287936000 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:37;0;0;"This has nothing to do with any website. There never was any contract that guaranteed pension at 60. Only pension at SPA, which can change."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:36;0;0;"Do you even know what the Cridland review is?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:36;0;0;"I am asking about current reports, issued in the last few months and freely available online. Have you read any of them?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:35;0;0;"They were, of course, told in the 1995 Act itself exactly what their retirement age would be. Here is the schedule. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/26/schedule/4/enacted …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:34;0;0;"They were never told that it WAS their retirement age."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:33;0;0;"7) Have you read any of Henry George's work?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:32;0;0;"6) Have you read any of the Resolution Foundation's work on the impact of austerity?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:31;0;0;"5) Have you read any of the Resolution Foundation's work on demographics?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:30;0;0;"4) Have you read the Cridland review of the future of the state pension?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:30;0;0;"I'm not attacking you, I am asking questions. Please answer them."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:29;0;0;"3) Have you read the Government's report on intergenerational fairness?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:29;0;0;"2) Could you also please tell me if you have read the most recent Government Actuary's report on social security funding?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:28;0;0;"1) Could you please tell me if you have looked at the NI fund accounts?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:27;0;1;"I've noticed that your typical response to questions is to issue insults. Do you actually know the answers to any of my questions?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:26;0;2;"Among the women's groups that fought against the SPA rise to 65 was the Women's Institute. Hardly a lefty organisation.....https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886033217945571328 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:25;0;0;"Hardly "in their absence". Women's groups fought against the SPA rise to 65.https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886033217945571328 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:24;0;2;"It is a statement of fact. I am sorry that you do not like the facts, but accusing me of Tory bias doesn't change them, sadly.https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886033217945571328 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:23;0;1;"You are very rude, Norbert. Doesn't exactly endear you to people."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:22;0;0;"What about the women born in the 1960s and 70s who have even larger SPA rises than the # WASPI women and have never been notified at all?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:21;0;0;"There was no contract. Any more than there was for me. My SPA has gone up by 6 years. It was 60 when I started work."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:20;0;2;"This is not a political answer, it is simply a statement of fact.https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886032166458712064 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:19;0;0;"what employers actually did was use the JRS as a cheap form of redundancy. Reducing men's SPA to 60 was never seriously discussed again."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:19;0;1;"JRS was a scheme which allowed employers to pension off men over 60. It was supposed to open up jobs for young ppl, but did not work"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:18;0;0;"that was due to high youth unemployment. Reducing men's SPA permanently to 60 was dismissed in favour of a Job Release Scheme"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:17;0;0;"Equalities Commission recommended 63 some time around 1983. And in 1980-1, the possibility of reducing men's SPA to 60 was considered."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:16;0;0;"What was unexpected, and fiercely opposed by women's groups in the early 1990s, was equalisation at 65."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:15;0;0;"Equalisation was debated at intervals throughout that twenty years. It certainly didn't come out of the blue - had long been expected."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:14;0;0;"In fact equalisation of pension ages should have been done twenty years before when the Equal Pay Act was enacted."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:14;0;0;"As a pensions professional, you also should know that after the Barber judgement, th anomalous early state pension of women had to end."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:13;0;0;"There was never any contractual obligation to deliver pension at 60. Pension at SPA, yes - but SPA can be changed by Parliament."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:12;0;0;"You are technically and legally wrong, and as a pensions professional you should know better. It was not "theirs". Never had been."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:11;0;0;"difference is lost on me. I'm not Scottish."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:10;0;0;"It rather depends when it is held, I agree. But I do think the next government is likely to be the opposite colour. Cyclical....."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:10;1;1;"I did, after much consideration. The currency union idea was a non-starter. Interestingly @ NIESRorg later reached the same conclusion."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:07;0;0;"no, he's SNP. Look at his biog."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:06;0;0;"And what do I claim to be? I wasn't aware that I had claimed to be anything, but no doubt you know better."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:05;0;0;"Yes, because Labour is the Opposition and the party most likely to form the next government. Your personal allegiance is irrelevant."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:02;0;0;"I did not say anyone was responsible."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:02;0;1;"I ridiculed no-one. And I know a lot about WASPI women. And neither of those gives you the right to attack me anyway."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:00;0;0;"Ok, so who is Henry George?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 09:00;0;0;"You missed the point yet again, Norbert. I've already said I don't care about your personal political allegiance."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:59;0;0;"Seriously. They kept it quiet because they haven't reached any conclusions yet. It got leaked, though. Promptly dubbed the "garden tax"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:58;0;0;"Stop making wild allegations about me. You just make yourself look silly. Let's have a rational discussion, eh?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:57;0;0;"Why don't you answer my question? Have you looked at the NI Accounts?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:55;1;1;"Would be a good subject for him. Especially as the Labour Party is looking at LVT."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:52;0;0;"I'd be surprised if our Norbert even knows who that is."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:50;0;0;"But the aggression was yours in the first place. It was a while ago, so I suppose you have forgotten that you started this."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:50;0;1;"When someone pops up out of the blue making wild unfounded allegations about me, I tend to be a little combative, yes."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:49;0;0;"If you know the SP is funded from current contributions, you must also know that there is no "theft". Have you looked at the NI accounts?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:46;3;1;"this is not good.....https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes/status/886021316238880768 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:43;0;1;"It would be unconstitutional."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:42;0;0;"It is not rocket science and I am not the only person who knows. As a self-proclaimed pensions professional, you should know. So explain it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:41;0;0;"So explain how the state pension is funded, then, if you are such an expert."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:37;0;0;"You don't seem to know how the state pension works. Or the NI system which funds it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:30;0;0;"looks that way."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:28;0;0;"Hmm. This one seems to want to be blocked."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:27;0;0;"*sigh* What part of "I am not a Tory" don't you get?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:26;0;0;"Yes. Hence the political crisis. Triggered by the Brexit vote but had been brewing for a very long time."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:22;0;0;"Losing your temper now?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:21;0;0;"hmm....nah, that won't buy me a glass of wine."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:21;0;1;"I'll block it soon."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:20;0;0;"It does. And it is astonishingly boring and repetitive."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:19;0;2;"Who do you think I am, the bird woman?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:19;0;1;"Apparently I'm not even really a woman. Hey, @ nadiacoppolaa, what do you think?https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886016948970151941 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:18;0;0;"How much? My price is high....."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:15;0;1;"That was his first tweet."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:14;0;0;"That's true. And a bot is only as logical as the person who created it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:14;0;0;"Indeed. Very worrying."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:13;0;1;"That's a point. But then the idea that someone might spend time creating a bot like that is also disquieting and tragic."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:12;0;1;"Good lord."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:12;0;1;"He's got something right at last. https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886015387602739201 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:11;0;1;"wow. thanks."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:11;0;0;"yeah, someone else has suggested it is a bot."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:10;0;0;"Though the name is certainly bot-like."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:10;0;0;"That's a troll, not a bot, surely?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:09;0;2;"Certainly nasty, but doesn't seem logical enough to be an algo."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:08;0;0;"Would you like me to call them off, then?https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886014203475238912 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:07;0;3;"Not my finest investment, that..... https://twitter.com/BuucketHe4d/status/886014081651662848 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:06;1;1;"Ooh, thanks! # FFhttps://twitter.com/prosandCONNsVT/status/886013925761970176 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:06;1;6;"Are we all bored with this troll, Twitter? Is it time to block him?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:05;0;0;"It's in their own interests."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:03;0;1;"Indeed not. Sometimes I just disagree for the hell of it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:02;0;0;"I expect to be taken seriously by you. You don't. I am now bored. Goodbye."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:01;0;1;"Very. And I am bored. I think this guy will have to be blocked. He is wasting my time and trying everyone else's patience."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 08:00;0;1;"Oh, so I work for the UK government now, do I? Is there no limit to your paranoid fantasies?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:59;0;0;"No idea."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:58;0;0;"Pleased to hear it."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:58;0;0;"Of course."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:53;0;0;"Yep."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:53;0;0;"Sssshhhh!"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:53;0;0;"Both your ignorance and your arrogance are evident from your tweets."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:52;0;0;"For once, I have to agree with you. I thought this day would never come."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:51;0;1;"Paypal?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:51;0;0;"Then learn. Stop being so arrogant, and read my work. I did the research so you don't have to."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:50;0;0;"Lies? I have told no lies. You allege that my income depends on keeping my followers. Ergo, they must pay me."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:49;0;0;"Why do you think that the fact that I am not rich makes me desperate to keep my followers, if they don't pay me?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:47;0;1;"You, on the other hand, pontificate about things you know nothing about and dismiss people who try to correct you. That's arrogance."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:47;0;0;"I took the trouble to research all of this thoroughly before reaching my conclusion. My claim to be an expert is well founded."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:46;0;0;"Because you are ignorant, but make no attempt to inform yourself because you think you know it all."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:46;0;0;"You aren't worth the trouble, frankly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:45;0;14;"Hey, followers, this guy thinks you pay me to tweet. Would you like to disillusion him?https://twitter.com/Norbertswizzle/status/886008135437225985 …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:44;0;0;"Crikey. You think I earn my living from the followers of my personal Twitter account?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:42;0;0;"I've told you already."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:42;0;0;"When are you going to stop this fruitless witch hunt? I'm not a Tory, you are wrong, move on."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:41;0;0;"I've already told you several times I am not a Tory. You appear incapable of understanding simple English."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:40;0;0;"When did Uriah become your middle name, Ms. Heep?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:40;0;0;"Yes of course you are. You can't see your own arrogance."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:40;0;5;"You act like an idiot, tweet like an idiot. You're 100% an idiot."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:38;0;0;"Raising SPA (not just for these women) keeps NICs affordable for younger people despite falling birth rates and rising longevity."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:36;0;0;"It has always worked like this. Insulting me doesn't make any difference to the facts. State pensions are paid from current workers' NICs."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:34;0;0;"There is no "theft" from these women because there was never anything to steal. NI is not a savings scheme. It is paid out on receipt."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:34;0;0;"If you had bothered to learn how the NI system works, you would not have made such an elementary mistake."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:31;0;0;"For the last time.....I am not a Tory. Have I said this sufficiently clearly for you to understand, dumbo?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:30;0;0;"Yes it is. You are too arrogant to read my work. Or even to inform yourself about how things work."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:29;0;0;"I really am. Read my work."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:28;0;0;"I do not need anything explaining, thank you. There is no "theft" from these women. Raising these women's SPA benefits younger people."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:27;0;0;"I think you are ill-informed and you say some damned stupid things. You also seem incapable of understanding my clearly stated position."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:26;0;1;"Frankly, your tweets are nearly incomprehensible. You don't appear to be able to write English coherently or understand it correctly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:24;0;0;"Hardly. I really am an expert on this. Unlike you."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:23;0;0;"Just read my work."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:23;0;0;"Understanding English is a typically Tory trait now, is it? Good lord."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:22;0;0;"I'm being kind. And helpful. You seem a tad touchy."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:21;0;0;"Google is pretty good at finding my work."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:21;0;1;"Yep, I do. You asked where I wrote about WASPI. I've told you. It's easy to find."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:20;0;0;"I've repeatedly explained why I oppose # WASPI."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:20;0;1;"What a silly remark. How on earth would attacking # WASPI make me rich? Do think it through."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:19;0;0;"If you struggle with the search, I will tweet you some links."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:18;0;0;"On my blog. Link is on my Twitter profile. Search for WASPI. I've updated it recently and the search is easier to use now."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:17;0;0;"I've explained repeatedly now why I do not support # WASPI. I am surprised that you still don't seem to understand my reasons."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:16;0;0;"I have explained my position. I oppose # WASPI, but support the cause of those worst affected by the 2011 Act."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:15;0;0;"Do you even understand English? Let me say it in words of one syllable. I AM NOT RICH."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:14;0;0;"No paywall. Everything I have written on WASPI is free to read."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:11;0;0;"I am saying exactly that, yes."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:10;0;0;"This is Twitter, not LinkedIn. Do you even know the difference?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:09;0;0;"The whole women's pension issue. And wider pensions matters, too. I've written extensively about this."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:09;0;1;"It seems you don't."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:08;0;0;"Why do you assume I am rich? You have no basis for that assumption either."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:07;0;1;"crikey, where do I start? Socialists are in favour of equality, aren't they?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:06;0;0;"You don't even know what the # WASPI ask is? Let me enlighten you. Here it is, from the WASPI campaign website today.pic.twitter.com/omE5Kv87la"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:05;0;0;"I'm not."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:04;0;1;"Oh, I understand. Far better than you do. I have been involved in this for over two years and have researched it thoroughly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:04;0;0;"If you have never come across me before, then telling me I have never said something before is utterly absurd. You can't possibly know."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:02;0;0;"No, dearie, it isn't. My career does not depend on what I say about # WASPI. You really don't know anything about me, do you?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:01;0;1;"You are utterly stupid because you say utterly stupid things."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 07:00;0;0;"The # WASPI ask would mean a woman only a few days older than me getting 6 years of bridging pension that # WASPI would deny to me."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:59;0;0;"I am only very slightly younger than the # WASPI women demanding pensions at 60. But they think it's fine for me to work on till 66."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:58;0;0;"You utterly stupid woman. Of course it matters to me. My own SPA has risen by 6 years. I had no more notification than you of that rise."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:57;0;0;"I am not remotely interested in your political allegiance. You can support the Monster Raving Loony party for all I care."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:56;0;0;"Since you didn't understand the first time, let me repeat what I said. I did not make any assumption about your political allegiance."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:55;0;0;"Or do you only look at the rubbish that # WASPI campaign and its supporters spout about me?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:54;0;0;"Yes I have. Repeatedly. Have you been asleep for the last two years or something?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:54;0;0;"No, because the elected representatives of the people of the United Kingdom voted to raise the state pension age, over 20 years ago."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:53;0;0;"I have repeatedly warned that # WASPI campaign's unreasonable demand would inevitably mean no help for anyone."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:52;0;0;"Imho the # WASPI campaign has destroyed any possibility of help for the 1950s women who are really struggling."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:50;0;1;"It certainly won't while the # WASPI campaign is rejecting everything that falls short of their demand for unconditional bridging pensions."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:49;0;0;"I don't see that there is anything to "get". You are asking for a pension to which you have not been entitled since 1995."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:49;0;0;"I really don't care what your political allegiance is. It is of no interest to me whatsoever."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:48;0;0;"I've made no assumption about you. I am pointing out that you have no basis for your assertion that I am a Tory."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:47;0;0;"I said I did not support unconditional payments to all 1950s women, not that there should be no support. What is your problem with this?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:47;0;3;"But I have accepted that. I said repeatedly that women who are facing genuine financial hardship should have targeted help."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:46;0;0;"It has never been guaranteed."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:44;0;0;"The money the government receives in NICs does not go to you. It goes to current pensioners, of which you are not yet one."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:44;0;0;"And they will be paid out, when you reach SPA. Not before. You have no entitlement to payment before you reach SPA."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:41;0;1;"Neither the amount of the state pension nor the age at which you will receive it have ever been guaranteed."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:40;0;0;"Both the amount of state pension you will receive and the age at which you will receive it are set by Parliament and can be changed."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:40;0;0;"No, you really haven't. Your NICs paid the pensions of others. You have paid nothing at all into your own pension."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:38;0;1;"They are promised a pension AT THEIR SPA. Not before. The number of years of contributions is irrelevant to this."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:37;0;1;"State pension ages were equalised in 1995, to take effect 2010 onwards. There is no way that legislation should be overturned now."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:37;1;0;"It's absolutely about inequality. Women receiving state pension five years earlier than men even though they live longer. Outrageous."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:36;0;0;"The state pension is actually a contributory benefit like JSA and ESA. They have both been changed without notice. The SP can be too."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:35;0;0;"You seem to think that the state pension is like a private or occupational pension - a "pot" invested on behalf of the saver. It is not."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:34;0;0;"The legislation is its own notice. That is the case for all legislation. You don't receive personal notice of every law passed, do you?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:34;0;1;"I do talk sense. Unfortunately my followers don't suffer fools gladly. If I talk to you for long, I will lose followers."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:32;0;1;"They have not "paid in" anything."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:32;0;1;"The # WASPI campaign is only about the rises in women's state pension age in 1995 and 2011. Nothing else."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:31;1;1;"Govt has no duty to inform personally. You, as citizens, are responsible for informing yourself about legislation that affects you."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:25;0;1;"Yes. As citizens, we are responsible for informing ourselves of legislation that affects us. Ignorance of the law is not a defence."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:24;0;0;"But it is simply incorrect to say it was changed without notice. You may not have noticed, but that is not the same."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:23;0;0;"The 1995 Act gave 15 years' notice. The 2011 Act gave much less notice, and I have always viewed this as unfair."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:18;0;1;"You don't think at all. You just trot out cliches. You don't know anything about me and your comments are both stupid and laughable."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:17;0;1;"They can expect all they like, but they are not entitled to anything until SPA, and SPA can be changed by Act of Parliament."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:16;0;0;"No. See the rest of my tweets about this."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:15;0;0;"Yes they are. # WASPI campaign is asking for an unconditional bridging pension for all women born in the 1950s on or after 6/4/51."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:14;0;0;"You are not entitled to a penny piece until you reach SPA, regardless of how many years of NI you have paid. That is the law."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:14;0;0;"And when you qualify for SP - which you don't until you reach SPA, regardless of NICs paid - your SP is paid from the NICs of younger ppl."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:13;0;0;"Nope. You do not "pay in" to a pension pot as in a private or occupational scheme. Your NICs are immediately disbursed to current pensioners"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:12;0;0;"I am happy for there to be targeted help for 1950s women genuinely facing financial difficulty, but not unconditional handouts."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:11;0;0;"And because I have kids who would have to pay higher tax and NICs to give you a pension of which they can only dream."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:10;0;0;"What a stupid question. Because I am one of those slightly younger women, obviously."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:06;0;0;"No you weren't. There was nothing to steal. There is no "pot" with your name on it and never has been. NI does not work like that."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:06;0;0;"So you want slightly younger women to pay for it, then. Nice."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:05;0;1;"The 2011 legislation affected every woman born after 5/4/53. 2014 legislation affected every woman born after 5/4/60. Where does this end?"

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:02;1;0;"No-one born in the 1950s gets state pension any later than their 66th birthday. And the # WASPI campaign is only for women born in the 1950s."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-15 06:01;0;0;"Nonsense. Eight years ago, no-one had to work till 67. Now, they do, but only if they are born in the 1970s."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:33;0;0;"# WASPI ask means woman born 31/12/59 receiving 6 years of bridging pension, but woman 1 day younger, nothing. Do you think this is fair?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:32;0;0;"No, I couldn't. # WASPI is not fighting for all would-be state pensioners, only for those born in the 1950s. I was told that by Anne Keen."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:28;0;0;"# WASPI campaign doesn't cover women born in the 1960s. We are told to "start our own campaign". The directors jeer at us."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:25;0;0;"So as far as I am concerned, my kids take priority. Their education is not free. I'd much rather help them than Steve's children."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:24;0;0;"Their children probably also benefited from free education, or at least much lower fees than my kids have to pay."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:23;0;0;"The grandparents who want me to fund their grandchildren's childcare benefited from free education."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:19;0;1;"Nope, simply need to bother to read things properly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:19;0;0;"This is once again about the 2011 Act, and I have already said I think that is unfair."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:18;0;1;"I don't really see why I should agree with the grossly unfair and horrendously expensive # WASPI ask."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:14;0;0;"And oppose the protests if you don't agree, as I am doing."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:02;0;1;"I don't want to pay any of my money towards your early pension, absolutely. Why should I?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:01;0;0;"I have to go to a conference call now, but will later provide you with information on how the NI system works, since you don't seem to know."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:00;0;0;"No-one has pilfered anything. The state pension is paid from NICs from current workers. NI is not a savings scheme. Never has been."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 23:00;0;0;"Nope, it is my FUTURE dues that would fund # WASPI early pensions. And I'm refusing to pay any more money to fund these women."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:59;0;0;"I have not agreed to give them any more tax and NI to fund # WASPI women. Nor would I."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:58;0;0;"No they aren't."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:57;0;1;"# WASPI campaign has no morals, no honour and no integrity."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:56;0;0;"Is it my fault that I was born a few days after them? # WASPI seems to think it is, since they want to deny me 6 years of pension."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:56;0;0;"This image is about the 2011 acceleration. I have already said that the 2011 acceleration was unfair."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:54;0;0;"You need to look closer to home for "rich and powerful". Start with the directors of @ WASPI_Campaign."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:53;1;1;"Also, why should I pay higher tax and NICs so this # WASPI campaign director can have 6 years more pension than me?http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12776392.HR_chief_resigns_following_discipline_charges/ …"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:51;0;0;"Please explain why you think it is fair for my classmate a few days older to have 6 YEARS more pension than me?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:51;0;0;"Nope, I just don't think I should have to pay for my classmate of the same age to have 6 years more pension than me."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:50;0;0;"Disagree with the linkage. 2011 Act was unfair. 2007 and 1995 were not."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:49;0;0;"Even if letters had been sent, you would still be complaining. You just want pension at 60."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:48;0;0;""Contributing to society" = paying higher tax & NICs so a woman only a few days older than me can have 6 years more pension? You're barking"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:47;0;0;"But as you are all saying that 2011 was too late for notification, it's irrelevant anyway, isn't it?"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:46;0;0;"The government gateway went live in early 2011, when women's SPA was still 60. When the error was found it was corrected."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 22:46;0;0;"yes, the government gateway website was wrong. But the DWP website was correct, as was the online SPA calculator."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:54;0;1;"Because I have followed # WASPI campaign for two and a half years, obviously."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:54;0;0;"That is the current mission statement."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:54;0;1;"So # WASPI then added a detail saying "bridging pension from 60 to SPA plus compensation for "lost" pension"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:53;0;1;"Then the claim became "fair transitional arrangements", which lots of people pointed out was meaningless."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:52;0;1;"That was changed after Ros Altmann pointed out that it effectively meant delaying the 1995 Act implementation by 10 years."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:52;0;2;"The original said "put women born in the 1950s on or after 6/4/51 in the same position that they would have been if born before 6/4/50"."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:51;0;0;"Yes it has. Repeatedly."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:51;0;0;"Nope, right from the start the objection has been to the legislation. # WASPI women just don't want to work till 66."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:50;0;0;"But pension from 60 is what # WASPI women are demanding. So it is not about maladministration. It is about the legislation itself."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:50;0;0;"Even if it did, that would not entitle you to a pension from 60 in contravention of the 1995 legislation."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:49;0;0;"Government has no duty to inform personally of legislative changes. Failing to do so therefore does not constitute maladministration."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:49;0;0;"Do you mean "pursue" this?"

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:47;0;0;"Oh, I grasp the claim. I just don't believe it. It's a smokescreen to conceal the real intention, which is to get SP at 60."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:46;1;0;"There are many reasons for suicide. It was utterly disgusting of # WASPI to claim suicide as being due to the pension issue."

Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:40;0;0;"Hardly "gaslighting" to point out that rolling back equalisation for 1950s women is grossly unfair to men and younger women."
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:38;0;0;"The only reason the campaign is now pursuing "maladministration" is that all other channels for challenging equalisation are closed. # WASPI"
Frances_Coppola;2017-07-14 19:38;0;0;"It is clear from thousands of comments made by # WASPI women over the last two years that the cause is equalisation."

Frances_Coppola;2017-06-15 18:46;0;0;"Greecd owes Germany a lot of money, including bilateral loans. Germany as creditor is resisting NPV losses. Hardly surprising."

Frances_Coppola;2016-05-22 05:46;0;0;"if fewer ppl than rental properties & competition btwn landlords rents will not rise in line with pay."
Frances_Coppola;2016-05-22 05:44;0;0;"Not necessarily. Depends how many ppl want rental properties. You assume tight market."

Frances_Coppola;2016-05-22 05:39;0;0;"er, yes I do. Economic profit is revenue minus opportunity cost - ie value added."
Frances_Coppola;2016-05-22 05:38;0;0;"this is pretty basic"

Frances_Coppola;2015-04-26 19:58;0;0;"@ Giusguglielmi The problem was that too many banks were actually insolvent. ECB & Fed liquidity support did not deal with that."

Frances_Coppola;2015-04-26 19:49;0;0;"@ Giusguglielmi Most likely because it did not have the money. DB paid cash for its initial stake. Then Lehman hit a few days later."
Frances_Coppola;2015-04-26 19:48;0;0;"@ Giusguglielmi It is precisely because of the accounting impact that the minority interest could not shield it from speculative attacks."
Frances_Coppola;2015-04-26 19:47;0;0;"@ Giusguglielmi No, you can't prove it. That's exactly my point. First move was justified as LT strategy even without ST funding benefits."

Frances_Coppola;2015-04-26 18:46;0;0;"@ Giusguglielmi Sorry, this just doesn't make sense. DB only acquired a minority stake in 2008. Would have made little diff to its funding."
