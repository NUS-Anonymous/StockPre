NASA;2015-11-06 05:09;23;39;"@ ddubb710 The radiation environment on the surface of Mars is something that we're monitoring with @ MarsCuriosity"
NASA;2015-11-06 05:08;14;35;"@ murmaidsci88 We do know that it had a field because there are parts of the ancient Mars crust that are still magnetized."
NASA;2015-11-06 05:08;15;21;"@Dustin_LongNJ We believe that the atmosphere that was lost, has been lost forever to interplanetary space."
NASA;2015-11-06 05:07;9;20;"@ gau3tam7 Earth’s magnetic field largely protects it from these processes."
NASA;2015-11-06 05:02;9;17;"@ BWest187 Storms on the sun happen all the time. These storms increase the UV & radiation environment that affect biological life adversely."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:51;16;26;"@ Hamda930 A compass would not point toward North at Mars. It would point toward the nearest and strongest crustal magnetic field."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:50;8;16;"@ Wjkirik The amount of liquid water on Mars is trace amounts. MAVEN is looking on a larger scale."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:50;19;32;"@ meekelis We see ancient dry river beds, ancient dry lakes - so Mars had to have had a thick atmosphere early on to support liquid water"
NASA;2015-11-06 04:49;4;11;"@srthvnnn Potentially small amount during the geologically brief time of switch. Earth's bigger w/ more gravity so hard for atoms to escape"
NASA;2015-11-06 04:49;3;11;"@MinaVesperGokal Any small scale magnetic field could potentially deflect local solar wind."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:48;5;13;"@ MenTor193 It used to. It was small, froze and stopped making a magnetic field."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:47;6;14;"@ truthordoor Both formed at about the same time, around 4.5 billion years ago."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:47;5;12;"@ SpeakSpanglish The @ Space_Station can see the Earth’s aurora, which are caused by solar winds entering the Earth’s atmosphere."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:46;7;14;"@ lngsd The Venus atmosphere is very thick. Similar processes are happening there, but so far it’s still a thick atmosphere."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:46;4;8;"@ Shankovich Yes, MAVEN measured solar wind on the way to Mars. It would depend on the shielding that the spacecraft would have."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:45;3;7;"@ RussellGarcia The rate of change in the loss is also due to solar activity, which we expect was greater during an early sun."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:45;5;12;"@ akgadam Magnetic fields originate at the core of planets. Mars is smaller than Earth, so the core had less heat to keep it molten."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:44;11;15;"@ DanielRika2 Earth is bigger & our core hasn't frozen. We still have a global magnetic field on Earth that helps shield us from solar winds"
NASA;2015-11-06 04:43;7;12;"@ BelleBella94 We believe that the Mars atmosphere and climate were significantly different billions of years ago, so yes."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:43;3;6;"@ CodyWillming Billions of years, at the current escape rate."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:43;3;5;"@ extrapale That is part of MAVEN’s investigation. We hope be able to estimate this."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:42;4;4;"@ GunzSonny It’s very unlikely that this would happen. We think much of it was blown away forever."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:42;4;5;"@ DigitalAbdullah MAVEN science results will help us understand and shape what astronauts will be studying at Mars."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:42;3;4;"@ yudisz It widely varies. Summertime at the equator it can get to as high as 10 degrees celsius. But in general it’s much below freezing."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:41;4;7;"@ Tekk45 Not directly, but understanding where the water went on Mars helps figure out where the resources are for future astronauts."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:41;5;8;"@ WindmarkUS We don’t know for sure. But we think that Mars' core was small and froze because there was less heat to keep it molten."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:40;22;42;"@ elakdawalla (2/2) There have been surprises. We've seen unexpected diffuse auroras, transient metal layers in the atmosphere & others."
NASA;2015-11-06 04:40;18;35;"@ elakdawalla In general, the models of the solar wind interaction w/ Mars' atmosphere have been largely validated. (1/2)"
NASA;2015-11-06 04:37;8;16;"@ Brummo Global magnetic fields form in the cores of planets. Mars' core is comparatively small and froze, so it's magnetic field ceased."
